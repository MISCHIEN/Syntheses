\section{Explain how lift can generated around an airfoil for inviscid incompressible flow.}

See Q2 for mathematical explanation.

When looking at an airfoil, we have a pressure that is applied around it. This pressure is non uniform, due to the presence of the airfoil. The integral of pressures over the surface gives a force expressed as the product of the incoming speed and the vorticity vector: the lift.

\subsection{Explain the origin of the bound vortex which exists around a profile which generates lift. Explain using the Kelvin theorem}
In inviscid case, the Kelvin theorem states that there cannot be vorticity, so no lift. If we take an arbitrary contour around the airfoil we will have no circultion. In inviscid case we can never get a lift $\rightarrow$ D’alembert paradox. At the trailing edge, if the flow wants to continue on the other corner from below, the velocity must be infinity so that the flow separates. But this is not the case in reality. \\

\begin{wrapfigure}[7]{r}{6.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{ch1/4}
	\captionof{figure}{}\label{fig1}
\end{wrapfigure}
To satisfy the Kutta condition (the flow has to leave the airfoil smoothly), there needs to be circulation if we take a contour that contains the airfoil, but for all contour that does not contain the airfoil it is null.  $\Gamma$ varies with the stagnation point position, but only one corresponds to the Kutta condition. \\

\begin{wrapfigure}[16]{l}{4cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{ch1/5}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
The bound vortex is the vortex around the airfoil. It is compensated by a starting vortex that detaches from the airfoil.

We can show that every contour containing the airfoil has a non 0 circulation. Let's proof that a contour that doesn't contain the airfowl has $\Gamma =0$: 

\begin{equation}
\oint _{C} \vec{v}\, d\vec{l} = \oint _{\mbox{airfoil}} \vec{v}\, d\vec{l} + \oint _{cd} \vec{v}\, d\vec{l} + \oint _{fg} \vec{v}\, d\vec{l} = 0. 
\end{equation}

As the contour elements are exactly opposed to each other, the result is null. 

\subsection{What is the start-up vortex, what happens with it when the flow reaches a steady state}
What happens is that initially we have the first kind of flow, then the formation of the starting vortex due to viscous effects (separation) which is compensated by a \textbf{bound vortex} around the airfoil (to respect Kelvin theorem of irrotational flow) that makes $\Gamma \neq 0$. Then the vortex goes away to infinity. Indeed if we take $R = \rho v_\infty \Gamma$, $\Gamma \neq 0$, so we have lift. 
\subsection{Explain the Kutta condition}
The Kutta condition states that the flow can only have a stagnation point at the trailing edge. If this was not the case, the underwing flow would need to accelerate "going backwards" to meet the upperwing flow, see figure~\ref{fig1}.

\section{Derive an expression for the aerodynamic lift of on airfoil for inviscid incompressible flow (i.e. neglecting viscous effects).}

\begin{wrapfigure}[9]{l}{7.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ch1/1}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}

The fundamental integral form of the mass conservation equation is:\\

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\int _V \rho \, dV + \oint _S \rho \vec{v} \, d\vec{S} = 0.
\end{equation}

By applying Gauss theorem $\oint _S \vec{a}.\vec{n}\, dS = \int _V \nabla\vec{a}\, dV$:

\begin{equation}
\int _V \left[\frac{d \rho}{d t} + \nabla .(\rho \vec{v})\right]\, dV = 0. 
\end{equation}

True for all volumes:

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Continuity equation}
		\begin{equation}
		\frac{d \rho}{d t} + \nabla .(\rho \vec{u}) = 0
		\label{eq:1.3}
		\end{equation}
	}		
\end{center}

General form of the momentum equation is: 

\begin{equation}
\rho \dot{\vec{v}} = \frac{\D \rho \vec{v}}{\D t} + \rho (\vec{v}\nabla ) \vec{v} = -\nabla p + \nabla \bar{\bar{\tau}}.
\end{equation}

Steady state, time derivative goes away. If we consider the x component of the velocity, we can expend the derivative to the whole left term as:

\begin{equation}
\rho (\vec{v}\nabla ) v_x = \nabla (\rho \vec{v} v_x) - v_x \cancel{\nabla (\rho \vec{v})}
\label{eq:1.5}
\end{equation}

where the last term is null related to \eqref{eq:1.3} in steady state. Integrating both sides around the volume contained in the closed surface S (abcdefghi on figure) in \eqref{eq:1.5}, and applying Gauss theorem, we obtain:

\begin{equation}
\oint _{S} \vec{v} (\rho \vec{v} \vec{n}) \, dS = -\oint _{S} p \, d\vec{S} + \oint _{S} \bar{\bar{\tau}} \, d\vec{S}.
\label{eq:1.6}
\end{equation}		 

New closed contour $S* = S - \mbox{airfoil} - cd - fg$ (previous abhi in fact). \eqref{eq:1.6} becomes:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\oint _{S^*} \vec{v} (\rho \vec{v} \, d\vec{S})  + \cancel{\oint _{\mbox{airfoil}} \vec{v} (\rho \vec{v} \, d\vec{S})} + \cancel{\oint _{cd+fg} \vec{v} (\rho \vec{v} \, d\vec{S})} 
\\&= -\oint _{S^*} p \, d\vec{S} -\oint _{\mbox{airfoil}} p \, d\vec{S}-\cancel{\oint _{cd + fg} p \, d\vec{S}}+ \oint _{S^*} \bar{\bar{\tau}} \, d\vec{S} +\oint _{\mbox{airfoil}} \bar{\bar{\tau}}\, d\vec{S} +\cancel{\oint _{cd + fg} \bar{\bar{\tau}}\, d\vec{S}}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:1.7}
\end{equation}

Forces applied to a wing:
\begin{equation}
\vec{R} = \oint _{\mbox{airfoil}} p\, d\vec{S} - \oint _{\mbox{airfoil}} \bar{\bar{\tau}}\, d\vec{S}	
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\oint _{S^*} \vec{v} (\rho \vec{v} \, d\vec{S}) = -\oint _{S^*} p \, d\vec{S} + \cancel{\oint _{S^*} \bar{\bar{\tau}} \, d\vec{S}} - \vec{R}.
\label{eq:1.9}
\end{equation}

Pressure effects induced by the body remains at a long distance from the body. We have to analyse the \textbf{non uniform} p along S*. In order to apply Bernouilli equation $p + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 = cst$, let's add the constants $p_\infty$ and $v_\infty$ to \eqref{eq:1.9}, as $\oint p_\infty\, d\vec{S} = p_\infty \oint d\vec{s} = 0$: 

\begin{equation}
\vec{R} = -\oint _{S^*} (p-p_\infty) \, d\vec{S} - \oint _{S^*} (\vec{v}-\vec{v}_\infty) \, d\dot{m}
\label{eq:1.12}
\end{equation}

Let's express $\vec{v} = \vec{v}_\infty + \vec{\delta _c}$ with $\vec{\delta _c}$ a perturbation. Introducing this in Bernouilli equation: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
p_\infty +\frac{1}{2} \rho \cancel{\vec{v}_\infty ^2} = p + \frac{1}{2} \rho( &\vec{v}_\infty + \vec{\delta _c})^2 = p + \frac{1}{2} \rho (\cancel{\vec{v}_\infty ^2} + 2 \vec{v}_\infty \vec{\delta _c} + \cancel{\vec{\delta _c}^2}) \\
&\Rightarrow p-p_\infty = - \rho\vec{v}_\infty \vec{\delta _c}	.		
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

If we replace this result in \eqref{eq:1.12}, we find:

\begin{equation}
\vec{R} =\oint _{S^*} \rho [(\vec{v}_\infty \vec{\delta _c}) \, d\vec{S} - \vec{\delta _c} [(\vec{v}_\infty . d\vec{S})]
\end{equation}

by using a vector property $\vec{a} \times (\vec{b} \times \vec{c}) = (\vec{a} \vec{b})\vec{c} - (\vec{a}\vec{c})\vec{b}$:

\begin{equation}
= \rho \vec{v}_\infty \times \oint _{S^*} \vec{\delta _c} \times d\vec{S} = \rho \vec{v}_\infty \times \left[\oint _{S^*} \vec{v} \times d\vec{S} - \cancel{\oint _{S^*} \vec{v}_\infty \times d\vec{S}}\right]
\end{equation}

and by applying Stokes theorem $\oint _S \vec{a} \times d\vec{S} = \int _V \nabla \times \vec{a} \, dV$:

\begin{equation}
= \rho \vec{v}_\infty \times \int  (\nabla \times \vec{v})\, dV = \rho \vec{v}_\infty \times \int  \vec{\omega}\, dV
\end{equation}

where $\vec{w}$ is the \textbf{vorticity vector} of direction $\vec{1}_z$ (pointing in the paper):

\begin{equation}
\vec{\omega} = 
\left| \begin{array}{ccc}
\vec{1}_x & \vec{1}_y & \vec{1}_z \\ 
\D _x & \D _y & 0 \\ 
v_x & v_y & 0
\end{array} 
\right| 
= [\D _x v_y - \D _y v_x] \vec{1}_z
\end{equation}

This shows that the lift force is always perpendicular to the flow!


\subsection{Express conservation of momentum over a closed surface S far away from the wing, neglecting viscous forces}
\begin{wrapfigure}[11]{l}{6.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{ch1/2}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
By considering this (assumption of far field), we can compute the force only by knowing the far field parameters. Indeed, uniform pressure implies null surface integral, so that \eqref{eq:1.9} becomes:

\begin{equation}
\vec{R} = -\oint _{S^*} \vec{v} (\rho \vec{v} \, d\vec{S}).
\end{equation}

The velocity term remains, as by experience we know that there is a \textbf{wake} making the velocity profile non-uniform. Let's now consider that the velocity is horizontal so that $\vec{R} = R.\vec{1}_x$, at the inlet we have $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{n}$ are opposed while at the outlet they are in the same direction: 

\begin{equation}
\vec{R} = \int _a^d \vec{v}\, d\dot{m} - \int _b^e \vec{v}\, d\dot{m} > 0
\end{equation}

showing that there is only \textbf{drag} force.

\subsection{Show that the lift force is linked to the vorticity through the closed surface S}
See above.
\subsection{Show that for the 2D airfoil the lift force is linked to the circulation around the airfoil, derive the Kutta-Joukowski formula for the lift generated by a 2D profile}

We will now introduce the circulation $\Gamma = - \oint \vec{v} \, d\vec{l} >0$   around a body. The convention is to take the anticlockwise direction for $d\vec{l}$ and so for $\Gamma$ to be $>0$ we must have $\vec{v}$ in the clockwise direction. There is a link between the lift force and the circulation. Let's introduce \textbf{Stokes theorem}:

\begin{equation}
\oint \vec{a} d\vec{l} = \int _S (\nabla \times \vec{a})\, d\vec{S} \qquad \Rightarrow -\Gamma = \int _S \vec{\omega} d\vec{S}.
\end{equation}

We remember that:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\vec{R} &= \rho \vec{v}_\infty \times \int  \vec{\omega}\, dV = \rho \vec{v}_\infty \times \int  l\vec{\omega}\, dS \qquad \Leftrightarrow \frac{\vec{R}}{l} = \rho \vec{v}_\infty \times \int  \vec{\omega}\, dS \\
\frac{\vec{R}}{l}&= \rho \vec{v}_\infty \times \int  \vec{\omega}\, (d\vec{S}.\vec{1}_z) = \rho \vec{v}_\infty \times (-\Gamma)\vec{1}_z = \rho v_\infty \Gamma \,\vec{1}_y
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

to finally obtain a very good approximation of the lift:

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Kutta formula for lift 2D airfoil}
		\begin{equation}
		|R| = \rho v_\infty \Gamma 
		\end{equation}
	}

\section{Characteristics of a 2D airfoil:}
\subsection{Define lift and drag, give the principle components of lift and drag force in normal operation and in case of separation}
	
\begin{wrapfigure}[9]{l}{7.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{ch2/3}
	\captionof{figure}{}
	\label{fig:2.2}
\end{wrapfigure}
Force applied on the wing:

\begin{equation}
\vec{R} = -\oint p \, d\vec{S} + \oint \bar{\bar{\tau}} \, d\vec{S} 
\end{equation}

with an external normal to the airfoil. The angle of attack is represented on \autoref{fig:2.2}.

The pressure term is responsible for lift and the friction term is responsible for drag. Friction forces work tangential to the airfoil and the pressure forces are perpendicular, if there is \textbf{no separation} in the flow. The drag created by the stress is called the \textbf{skin} or \textbf{friction} drag. 
Note that in a subsonic inviscid incompressible flow, we have the paradox of d’Alembert because we have no drag. This shows that the pressure only contributes to lift. \\

\textbf{Separation}: region above the airfoil where $p-p_\infty \approx 0$ $\Rightarrow$high pressure below $p\gg p_\infty$ that slows down the wing. This implies that the applied force is higher than the case without separation and due to the attack angle, the drag force too. This phenomenon is called \textbf{pressure drag} (form drag), and here the pressure contributes to drag.


\subsection{Explain the non-dimensional force coefficients($C_l$, $C_d$, $C_m$) and which are the similarity parameters influencing these coefficients}
Let’s look to the non-dimensional parameters that will influence the lift, the drag and the momentum. We have to define some reference quantities: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cccc}
L_{ref} = C & v_{ref} = v_\infty & t_{ref} = L_{ref}/v_{ref} & \rho _{ref} = \rho _\infty \\
t’= t/t_{ref} & p_{ref} = \rho _{ref} \frac{v_{ref} ^2}{2} & \mbox{Mach} = V_{ref} / a_{ref} & a_{ref} = \gamma \pi T_{ref} \\
\gamma = c_p / c_v && Re_{ref} = \frac{\rho _{ref} v_{ref} L_{ref}}{\mu _{ref}} &
\end{array}
\end{equation}					

where $a$ is the speed of sound. By replacing all these in the mass, momentum and energy equations, we obtain the non-dimensional ones (see Fluid Mechanics II):

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\bullet\frac{\D \rho '}{\D t'} + \nabla \left(\rho ' \vec{v}'\right) = 0\\
&\bullet\rho ' \frac{d\vec{v}'}{dt'} = - \frac{1}{\gamma M^2_{ref}}\nabla p' + \frac{1}{\mbox{Re}_{ref}}\nabla \bar{\bar{\tau}'}\\
&\bullet\frac{d}{dt'}(\rho ' e')+ \frac{\gamma (\gamma -1)}{2} M^2_{ref}\frac{d}{dt'}(\rho ' \vec{v'}^2 ) \\
&= \frac{\gamma}{Pr_{ref}Re_{ref}} \nabla (k'\nabla T') - (\gamma -1)\nabla (p'\vec{v}')+ \gamma (\gamma -1) \frac{M_{ref}^2}{Re_{ref}} \nabla (\bar{\bar{\tau}}'\vec{v}')			\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We can see that a solution can only be function of 4 parameters: $M, Re, Pr = \frac{c_p \mu}{k}, \gamma$, but we know that the geometry and the angle of attack $\alpha$ have a role by means of the boundary conditions. Then, we assume that the fluid is air ($\gamma =1.4$) and that we can neglect heat effects (no influence of Pr, incompressible and so low speed flows). The non-dimensional lift, drag and moment are thus function of M, Re, geometry and $\alpha$. We can define \textbf{lift}, \textbf{drag} and \textbf{moment coefficient} as (we forget about compressibility $\rightarrow$ M, and Re effects are low for $C_L and C_M$): 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&C_L(\cancel{M}, \cancel{Re}, geometry, \alpha) = \frac{L}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _{ref} v^2_{ref} S} \\
&C_D(\cancel{M},Re, geometry, \alpha) = \frac{D}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _{ref} v^2_{ref} S}		\\
&C_M(\cancel{M}, \cancel{Re}, geometry, \alpha) = \frac{M}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _{ref} v^2_{ref} Sc}
\end{aligned}	
\label{eq:2.18}		
\end{equation}

where L, D, M are the \textbf{dimensional} forces, c the mean chord (S/b) and S a reference surface (3D wing $\rightarrow$ total wing surface, 2D wing $\rightarrow$ S = c). We can experimentally show that the lift increases mainly linearly with $\alpha$ and the drag force is caused by friction effects and pressure differences involving with $\alpha$. This gives the following equations (lower case for 2D):

\begin{equation}
c_l = m(\alpha - \alpha _{L_0}) \qquad c_d = c_{d_0} + kc^2_l
\end{equation}

where $m\approx 2\pi$ theoretically and 5.7 practically, k is a constant of order of magnitude 0.01.

\subsection{Explain:}
\textbf{center of pressure CP:} It's the x value on the chord where the carrier of the force $\vec{R}$ intersects the chord. It's function of the angle of attack. Indeed, if alpha increases, the suction peak will be higher, this induces that the center of pressure move forward (participation of the forward pressure more important).\\

Note that the center of pressure is not a fixed point. Indeed, it varies with the angle of attack: if $\alpha \nearrow$, the pressure peak on the LE is more important making the $x_p$ move upstream, and the contrary for $\alpha \searrow$. This notion will be completed by the \textbf{zero lift angle} $\alpha _{0}$.

\textbf{equivalent force system in an arbitrary point Q on the chord of the profile:} 
\begin{wrapfigure}[7]{l}{3cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{ch2/11}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
The force at the pressure center P is equivalent to another force in point Q, but by adding the moment to compensate the one added by moving the force. This moment is:

\begin{equation}
\vec{C_Q} = -\vec{PQ}\times \vec{R}.
\end{equation}
\textbf{aerodynamic center AC:} Suppose that there is a point Q where the couple $C_Q$ is independent of the angle of attack (because the pressure center changes with alpha). This point is called the aerodynamic center.

The moment at this point is always nose-down and the point is situated upstream to the center of pressure.

\textbf{the graph of the momentum coefficient $c_m$ at a point Q versus the
	lift coefficient $c_l$ for Q located at the trailing edge, at the leading edge and at
	the aerodynamic center of the profile:} It is shown experimentally that:

\begin{equation}
c_m(Q) = c_{m_0} + k c_l
\label{eq:2.11}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{ch2/14}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{center}
$k$ is a constant that is related to the reference point chosen. If $Q$ is taken on the LE for example, increasing $\alpha$ will produce an increase of the lift and make the center of pressure move upstream. The L increase will compensate the moving $x_p$ such that the moment becomes even more noose-down (more negative following $\vec{1}_z$) $\Rightarrow k<0$ for a decrease in \eqref{eq:2.11}. The same reasoning applied on the trailing edge gives $k>0$. 
\subsection{Compute the Location of the center of pressure CP as a function of the angle of	attack alpha}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cccc}
1) & c_m = c_{m_0} + kc_l & 2)& M_{ac} = (x_{ac}-x_{cp})N \\
3) & m_{ac} = M_{AC} = M_0 <0 & 4) & N = n(\alpha-\alpha _0)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The AC being always upstream the CP the difference in 2) is $<0$. In 4), $n>0$. By using equation 3,4 and 2, we can compute:

\begin{equation}
M_0 = -(x_{cp}-x_{ac}).n(\alpha - \alpha _0) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad -\frac{M_0}{n} = (x_{cp}-x_{ac}).(\alpha - \alpha _0)
\end{equation}


\begin{wrapfigure}[8]{l}{4.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ch2/17}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
This is the equation of an \textbf{hyperbola}. To see it, we only have to compute the limits of:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
x_{cp} = x_{ac} - \frac{M_0}{n}\frac{1}{\alpha - \alpha _0}\\
\lim _{\alpha \rightarrow \pm\infty} x_{cp} = x_{ac} \qquad \lim _{\alpha \rightarrow \alpha _0 >0} x_{cp} = +\infty \qquad \lim _{\alpha \rightarrow \alpha _0 <0} x_{cp} = -\infty
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Let's finally say that commonly, $x_{ac} = cst \approx \frac{1}{4}C$.
\subsection{Explain the lift, drag and moment curves as a function of the angle of attack alpha}
Starting from what is said in 3.2, experiment showed that lift is increasing linearily with $\alpha$, and drag goes proportionnaly to $c_l^2$. The moment is proportionnal to $c_l$, we thus expect it to be linear with respect to $\alpha$.

\subsection{Explain what is stall and critical angle of attack. Explain different types of stall.}
\begin{wrapfigure}[11]{l}{6cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.16]{ch2/18}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
At a certain angle of attack ($\approx 15\degres$), the lift suddenly drops. This is due to massive separation on the suction side (reverse pressure gradient too high) and happens at the \textbf{critical angle of attack}. This phenomenon is called \textbf{stall}. In the separated part, the pressure will no longer decrease and will form a pressure plateau. \\

We have to make the difference between leading-edge stall and trailing-edge stall. For \textbf{leading-edge stall}, the massive separation occurs suddenly near the LE resulting 

\begin{wrapfigure}[13]{r}{5.7cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{ch2/19}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
in a strong and sudden drop of lift, when at maximum lift. This especially occurs to thin airfoils with cross-sections between 10 and 16\% of the chord. For the \textbf{trailing-edge stall}, the point of separation gradually goes upstream with increasing angle of attack resulting in a more gradual drop of lift (more thick airfoils). The comparison is done on the right figure. We can also see a third type of stall called \textbf{thin airfoil stall} with the example of a flat plat.  \\

In conclusion, the LE must be sufficiently rounded to have a good maximum lift. In fact the profile may nor be too 

\begin{wrapfigure}[8]{l}{7cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{ch2/20}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
thick  nor too thin. The figure on the left shows the influence of the thickness on the lift. We notice that the optimum thickness is situated around 12\% of the chord.The maximum lift increases with RE, indeed higher the Re, higher is the ratio of speed versus viscosity. So we can better oppose to separation. Unlike the Re number, the roughness has great effects on the maximum lift. Finally, let's notice that the camber have also an effect on maximum lift, the best is a camber of 8 up to 10\%.

\begin{equation}
L = C_L \frac{1}{2} \rho _{ref} v^2_{ref} S.
\label{eq:2.21}
\end{equation}

The lift force must always at least be equal to the weight of the plane. This implies that for low speed (take-off and landing), the $C_L$ must be large. This is accomplished with large $\alpha$ and slats or flaps. The minimum speed where the lift can still balance the weight ($C_L$ maximum) is called \textbf{stall speed} and from \eqref{eq:2.21} we find:

\begin{equation}
v_{stall} = \sqrt{\frac{W}{C_{L_{max}} \frac{1}{2} \rho_{ref} S}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Discuss the polar curve of the airfoil, i.e. lift coefficient as a function of drag	coefficient, show the glide ratio on this plot}
\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{4cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{ch2/21}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
The curve that represents $C_L$ in function of $C_D$ is the \textbf{polar curve} of the wing. The ratio $\frac{C_L}{C_D}$ is the \textbf{glide ratio} or \textbf{finesse} and is like an efficiency parameter. 

\subsection{What is the importance of the glide ratio, discuss the case of a gliding plane	(engine off situation)}
The best parameter is obtained using the graph by calculating $\beta$ such that: 

\begin{equation}
\tan \beta = \left(\frac{C_L}{C_D}\right)_{max}
\end{equation}						

This point is important for the quality of the wing because if we plot the thrust, the lift, the drag and the weight of a plane describing a horizontal flight (\autoref{fig:2.21}), the thrust is given by:

\begin{equation}
T = \frac{L}{\tan \beta} = \frac{W}{\tan \beta}
\end{equation}

where we see that when $\tan \beta$ (so the glide ratio) increases, T decreases. Another interpretation can be given when we have no thrust (\autoref{fig:2.22}). In this case the gliding ratio has to be adapted to travel the larger distance knowing that:

\begin{equation}
\frac{C_L}{C_D} = \frac{\mbox{distance travelled}}{\mbox{height loss}}
\end{equation}

\section{Computation of inviscid irrotational flow around a 2D airfoil using conformal mapping - Joukowski profiles}
\subsection{Explain methods based on complex potential function, explain the connection with usual stream function and potential function}
We will begin here with steady, inviscid irrotational flows. This gives for the mass conservation equation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D \rho}{\D t} + \nabla (\rho \vec{v}) = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \nabla \vec{v} = 0 = \D _x u + \D _y v
\end{equation}

In the other hand, we have the assumption of irrotational flow:

\begin{equation}
\vec{\omega} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \D _x v - \D _y u = 0.
\end{equation}

Then we define the \textbf{complex potential function w}:

\begin{equation}
w = \phi + I\psi
\end{equation}		 

where $\phi$ is the \textbf{potential function} (satisfies $w=0$ by construction) such that:

\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&u = \D _x \phi \\
&v = \D _y \phi
\end{aligned}
\right.
\qquad
\nabla \phi = \vec{v} = \D _x\phi \vec{1} _x + \D _y \phi \vec{1}_y
\end{equation}

We must satisfy the mass conservation equation:
\begin{equation}
\nabla (\nabla \phi) = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \Delta \phi = 0 
\end{equation}

coupled with boundary conditions, we can find a solution $\phi (x,y)$. The \textbf{stream function} satisfies the mass conservation by construction:

\begin{equation}
\left\{ 
\begin{aligned}
&u = \D _y \psi\\
&v = - \D _x \psi
\end{aligned}
\right.
\qquad \Rightarrow \D _x u + \D _y v = 0 \Leftrightarrow \D _x (\D _y \psi) + \D _y (- \D _x \psi) = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{wrapfigure}[8]{l}{4cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ch2/24}
	\label{fig:2.23}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
We still have to verify the $\omega=0$ condition:
\begin{equation}
\D _x v - \D _y u = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \frac{\D ^2 \psi}{\D x^2} + \frac{\D ^2 \psi}{\D y^2} = 0 \qquad \Delta \psi = 0
\end{equation}
A streamline and a potential line are perpendicular to each other:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \psi . \nabla \phi = \D _x \psi \D _x \phi + \D_ y \psi \D _y \phi = -vu + uv = 0. 
\end{equation}

	Analytical means differentiable. This consist in defining a function $f(z)$ analytical such that:

\begin{equation}
w = f(z) \qquad z,\omega \in \mathbb{C} \qquad \Rightarrow w = \phi +i \psi \qquad \left\{
\begin{aligned}
&z= x+iy\\ 		 
&\phi = \phi (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}\\
&\psi =  \psi(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}
\end{aligned} 		  
\right.
\end{equation}

If this is differentiable everywhere, $\Delta \phi = \Delta \psi = 0$. 

\subsection{Explain how the velocity can be computed from the complex potential	function}

The complex velocity (velocity field):

\begin{equation}
\frac{dw}{dz} = \frac{df}{dz} = A + iB \qquad A = \frac{\D \phi}{\D x} = - \frac{\D \psi}{\D y} = u \quad B = \frac{\D \psi}{\D x} = - \frac{\D phi}{\D y} = -v
\end{equation}

A property of this $f(z)$ is the superposition principle: $w_1 = f_1(z), w_2 = f_2(z)$ so $w_1 + w_2 = f_1(z)+f_2(z)$.
\subsection{Derive the complex potential function for uniform flow, source/sink flow, free vortex}
\subsubsection{Uniform flow}

\begin{equation}
w = U z \qquad \frac{d w}{dz} = U = u+iv \qquad \Rightarrow u = U; v = 0
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Source / Sink}
\begin{wrapfigure}[8]{r}{3cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{ch2/25}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
In this case, using the cylindrical coordinates, the complex potential is defined as ($\Lambda$ being the volumetric flow): 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&w = \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi} \ln z = \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi} \ln (r e^{i\theta}) = \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi} (\ln r + i\theta) \\
&\Rightarrow \phi = \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi} \ln r, \psi =  \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi}\theta.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We see that complex lines corresponds to $r =cst$ so are circles and streamlines $\theta = cst$ are line of constant angle. $\oint \vec{v}\, d\vec{l}=0$ as velocity is everywhere tangent to any circular contour. Let's compute the derivative for the velocity field:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dw}{dz} = \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi z} = \frac{\Lambda (x-iy)}{2\pi (x^2+y^2)} = \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi r} (\cos \theta - i \sin \theta).
\end{equation}

We see that the velocity decreases in $1/r$, this is due to the constant mass flow, so if the surface increases with r the velocity has to decrease to keep $\dot{m} = \rho v S$ constant. 

\subsubsection{Free vortex}
\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{l}{3cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{ch2/26}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
We do the same as the other cases: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&w = \frac{i\Gamma}{2\pi} \ln z = \frac{i\Gamma}{2\pi} \ln (re^{i\theta}) = \frac{i\Gamma}{2\pi} (\ln r + i\theta) = -\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi} \theta + \frac{i\Gamma}{2\pi} \ln r \\
&\phi = -\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi} \theta, \psi = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi} \ln r
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We see that this is the inverse case of the previous one, streamlines are circles oriented in negative rotational motion around z-axis (z entering in the sheet) so clockwise. We can compute the velocity field by deriving among z and we find that: 

\begin{equation}
u = \frac{\Gamma \sin \theta}{2 \pi r} \qquad v = -\frac{\Gamma \cos \theta}{2\pi r}
\end{equation}

Let's specify that $v_\theta = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\D \phi}{\D \theta} = -\frac{\Gamma}{2 \pi r}$, and that we have a vortex singularity in the center because $\Gamma = 0. \infty$.

\subsection{Compute flow around Rankine body and around a cylinder}

	\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{r}{5.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{ch2/27}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
Let's make a combination of a uniform flow and a source + sink as shown on the figure. The combination gives:

\begin{equation}
w = Uz + \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi} \ln \frac{z+a}{z-a}= Uz + \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi} \ln \frac{1+a/z}{1-a/z}.
\end{equation}

To have the flow around a cylinder we need to compute the limit $a\rightarrow 0$, and will need the Taylor expansion of $\ln$:

\begin{equation}
\ln \frac{1+\epsilon}{1-\epsilon} \approx 2 \epsilon + \cancel{o(\epsilon ^3)} \qquad \Rightarrow \lim _{a\rightarrow 0} w = \lim _{a \rightarrow 0} \left[ Uz + \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi} 2 \frac{a}{z} \right]
\end{equation}

by defining $\mu = 2\Lambda a$ we find the \textbf{flow around a cylinder}:

\begin{equation}
w = Uz + \frac{\mu }{2\pi z}.
\label{eq:2.42}
\end{equation}

If we replace $z= x+iy$ to find $\phi$ and $\psi$ we find:

\begin{equation}
\phi = Ux + \frac{\mu}{2\pi }\frac{x}{r^2} \qquad \psi = Uy - \frac{\mu }{2\pi} \frac{y}{r^2}.
\end{equation}

In this flow a closed streamline exists forming the so called \textbf{Rankine body} and which describes a cylinder in the case $a\rightarrow 0$. Indeed it is possible to find an exact solution for $\psi = 0$. This configuration has a symmetry according to x and y-axis when taking the center of the cylinder as origin. This implies that $\vec{F} = - \oint _{cyl} p\, d\vec{S} = 0$. This is the so called \textbf{paradox of d'Alembert} because we expect to find at least a drag force. A lift force can be find on the cylinder by adding a vortex. We conclude by saying that we can rewrite \eqref{eq:2.42} as (R the radius of the cylinder):

\begin{equation}
w = U\left( z + \frac{R^2}{z} \right) \qquad with \ R^2 = \frac{\mu }{2\pi U}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Explain how a the class of Joukowski profiles is obtained by conformal mapping of a circle}
\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{l}{5.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{ch2/28}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
Let's do a mapping, a transformation, to try to find our airfoil based on simple geometries. Let's as first example apply the transformation $Z = z + \frac{R^2}{z}$ to the cylinder of radius R. Let's first remark that the cylinder will become a flat plate:

\begin{equation}
Z = z + \frac{R^2}{z} = Re^{i\theta}  \frac{R^2}{Re^{i\theta}} = 2 R \cos \theta 
\end{equation}

Indeed, as $\cos \theta \in [-1,1]$ and the result is real, we have a flat plate between -2R and 2R in the x-axis. The flow Z is directly found: $W(Z) = UZ$. The second example will be the application of the same transformation on a cylinder of this time radius $r>R$. In this case the circle becomes an ellipse:

\begin{equation}
Z = r e^{i\theta} + \frac{R^2}{r^2}e^{-i\theta} = \left( r + \frac{R^2}{r} \right)\cos \theta + i \left( r - \frac{R^2}{r} \right) \sin \theta.
\end{equation}		 

Let's also compute the velocity field using the chain rule:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dW}{dZ} = \frac{dw}{dZ} = \frac{dw}{dz}\frac{dz}{dZ} = \left( 1 -\frac{r^2}{z^2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{1-\frac{R^2}{z^2}} \right).
\end{equation}

We see that the expression becomes infinite when $z^2 = R^2$. The reason is that the transformation is not analytical in these points so they must not be in the flow. 

The examples are summarized in the figures below 

\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch2/29}
		\captionof{figure}{}
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ch2/30}
		\captionof{figure}{}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Now suppose that we place no longer the center of the cylinder at the origin, but on the real axis. The mapping of the cylinder now takes the shape of a \textbf{symmetrical wing profile}. We see that there is two remarkable points that are H and A corresponding to the points $H_1$ and $A_1$ of the black and red circles, our profile is in between them. Now to give camber we only have to move the center of the cylinder on the y-axis. Please reffer to figures below. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{ch2/31}
		\captionof{figure}{}
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ch2/32}
		\captionof{figure}{}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Note that for the green circle in first figure, the complex potential becomes:

\begin{equation}
w = U\left( z-z_c + \frac{r^2}{z-z_c} \right)
\end{equation}

As last remark, let's remind that we had singularities in the second example. These points corresponds here to $H_1$ and $S_1$. The mapping of $H_1$ is always H the trailing edge, the velocity is there infinitely large. This was the discussion we've previously done with the stagnation point that has to move on the trailing edge otherwise $v = \infty$ because of the sharp edge. We can solve this by adding a vortex. This methods gives a limited amount of airfoils.

\section{Computation of inviscid irrotational flow around a thin airfoil based on a	continuous distribution of vortices}
\subsection{Explain what is a free vortex}

A free vortex is an irrotationnal vortex where the flow velocity u is inversely proportional to the distance r.
\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{l}{3cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{ch2/26}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}

Streamlines are circles oriented in negative rotational motion around z-axis (z entering in the sheet) so clockwise. We can compute the velocity field by deriving among z and we find that: 

\begin{equation}
u = \frac{\Gamma \sin \theta}{2 \pi r} \qquad v = -\frac{\Gamma \cos \theta}{2\pi r}
\end{equation}

Let's specify that $v_\theta = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\D \phi}{\D \theta} = -\frac{\Gamma}{2 \pi r}$, and that we have a vortex singularity in the center because $\Gamma = 0. \infty$.

\subsection{Explain what is a continuous distribution of free vortices on a line}

A way to represent thin airfoils is to use only their camberline and to retrieve the flow using an infinite line of free vorticies (or sources). A infinite line of vorticies thus represents an infinite thin airfoil.

\subsection{Explain principle of the method of free vortex distribution applied thin airfoils, limitations and hypotheses}

We will suppose infinitely thin airfoil and small angle of attack, so that the airfoil is represented by the camber line. This means also small camber about 2-3\% of the chord and $\alpha <8\%$. We can try to retrieve the flow by superposition principle by using infinite number of elementary sources or elementary vorticies. The potential function for the sources is:

\begin{equation}
\phi = \frac{\Lambda}{2\pi} \ln r \qquad d\phi = \frac{d\Lambda}{2\pi} \ln r
\end{equation}		

We then describe the source distribution by the source intensity $\lambda = \frac{d\Lambda}{ds}$ on a part $ds$ of the wing so that the last equation becomes:

\begin{equation}
d\phi = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi} \ln r\, ds.
\end{equation}

We will use the second method presented now which is using the vorticies: 

\begin{equation}
\phi = -\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi} \theta \qquad \vec{v} = \nabla \phi = \underbrace{\frac{\D \phi}{\D r} \vec{1}_r}_{= v_r = 0} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{r} \frac{\D \phi}{\D \theta} \vec{1} _\theta}_{= v_\theta} \qquad \Rightarrow v_\theta = -\frac{\Gamma }{2\pi} \frac{1}{r}.
\end{equation}

In the same way as the other we can define a \textbf{vortex intensity} to characterize the vortex distribution on a part ds $\gamma = \frac{d\Gamma}{ds}$, the derivative of $\phi$ and the elementary velocity are then: 

\begin{equation}
d\phi = -\frac{\gamma}{2\pi} \theta \, ds \qquad dv_\theta = -\frac{\gamma ds}{2\pi r}.
\end{equation}

The aim now is to make that infinitely thin airfoil a streamline. We assume because of superposition that the flow is a uniform flow $\vec{U}_\infty$, that we have an angle of attack $\alpha$. Because of the vorticies, we have a velocity perturbation $\vec{v}$ such that the total velocity is: 

\begin{equation}
\vec{V}_\infty = \vec{U}_\infty + \vec{v}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Establish the integral equation which allows to compute the vortex distribution for a given profile}

\begin{wrapfigure}[9]{l}{8.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{ch2/33}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
We must now choose $\gamma$ such that $\vec{V}$ is tangential to the airfoil everywhere (we want the camber line to be a streamline). In other words, $\forall P$ the normal component of the velocity should be null $V_{nP} = U_{\infty _{nP}} + v_{nP} = 0$. Let's determine these components by projection. First, for $U_{\infty _{nP}}$ we can remark the sum of angle $\alpha$ and the camber line slope $\tan \beta =  \left(-\frac{dz}{dx}\right)_p \Rightarrow \beta = -\arctan \left(\frac{dz}{dx}\right)_p$, the projection is (camber line: $z = f(x)$):

\begin{equation}
U_{\infty _{nP}} = U_\infty \sin \left[ \alpha - \arctan \left(\frac{dz}{dx} \right)_P \right].
\label{eq:2.54}
\end{equation}	 

Now for $v_{np}$, we consider an elementary vortex on a point $x$ on the airfoil that creates an elementary perturbation $\delta v_n$ on point P. This velocity direction is $\theta$ in a $(r,\theta)$ axis with origin at x, so perpendicular to r on the figure. If the angle with the normal is $\delta _3$, the projection will be:

\begin{equation}
\delta v_n = -\frac{\gamma (x) ds}{2\pi r} \cos \delta _3 .
\end{equation}

Now we have infinite number of contribution of the infinite vorticies, as $\gamma , r$ and $\delta _3$ depend on position $P$, we have to integrate over the whole airfoil:

\begin{equation}
v_n = - \frac{1}{2\pi }\int _0 ^c \frac{\gamma (x) ds}{r} \cos \delta _3
\end{equation}

where $c$ is the chord length. We can express both $r$ and $ds$ in function of x as: 

\begin{equation}
r = \frac{x_P - x}{\cos \delta _2} \qquad ds = \frac{dx}{\cos \delta _1}
\end{equation}

which gives 
\begin{equation}
v_n = - \frac{1}{2\pi }\int _0 ^c \frac{\gamma (x) dx}{x_P - x} \frac{\cos \delta _2}{\cos \delta _1}\cos \delta _3. 
\end{equation}

We are able to reconsider the condition \eqref{eq:2.54} by replacing our results: 

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\begin{equation}
		\frac{1}{2\pi }\int _0 ^c \frac{\gamma (x) dx}{x_P - x} \frac{\cos \delta _2}{\cos \delta _1}\cos \delta _3 =  U_\infty \sin \left[ \alpha - \arctan \left(\frac{dz}{dx} \right)_P \right].
		\end{equation}
	}
\end{center}

This is a relatively complicated equation, we can simplify it by \textbf{assuming a small camber} (in practice 2\% of the chord), which allows to say that $\delta _1 \approx \delta _2 \approx \delta _3 \approx 0$ and $\arctan \left( \frac{dz}{dx}\right) _P = \left( \frac{dz}{dx}\right) _P$. By considering $\alpha$ small, $\sin \alpha \approx \alpha$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2\pi} \int _0 ^c \frac{\gamma (x)\, dx}{x_P - x} = U_{\infty}\left[ \alpha -  \left(\frac{dz}{dx} \right)_P \right].
\end{equation}

We will introduce a new variable $\theta$, considering $x = \frac{1}{2}c (1-\cos \theta)$ and $dx = \frac{1}{2}c \sin \theta\, d\theta$: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2\pi} \int _0 ^{\pi} \frac{\gamma (\theta)\sin \theta \, d\theta}{\cos \theta - \cos \theta _P} = U_{\infty}\left[ \alpha -  \left(\frac{dz}{dx} \right)_P \right].
\label{eq:2.61}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Show how to solve this equation using a spectral method, i.e. by expressing	the vortex distribution as a truncated Fourier series}


Let's express $\gamma (\theta )$ in series: 

\begin{equation}
\gamma (\theta ) = 2U_\infty \left(A_0 \coth \frac{\theta }{2} + \sum _{n=1}^\infty) A_n \sin (n\theta)\right).
\end{equation}

This is in fact a solution of the last equation. 

Now we can replace this definition on the previous equation, knowing that $\coth (\theta /2) \sin \theta = 1+\cos \theta$ and writing $\theta _P = \theta '$, we get:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2\pi} \int _0 ^{\pi} \frac{\gamma (\theta)\sin \theta \, d\theta}{\cos \theta - \cos \theta _P}  = \frac{U_\infty}{\pi} \left[ \int _0 ^{\pi} \frac{A_0 (1+\cos \theta ) \, d\theta}{\cos \theta - \cos \theta '} + \sum _n A_n \int _0 ^{\pi}  \frac{\sin (n\theta)\sin \theta \, d\theta}{\cos \theta - \cos \theta '}  \right]
\end{equation}

By using the equality here and the \textbf{Glauert integral}:

\begin{equation}
\sin (n\theta ) \sin \theta = - \frac{1}{2} [\cos [(n+1)\theta] - \cos [(n-1)\theta]] \qquad \int _0 ^\pi \frac{\cos (n\theta)\, d\theta}{\cos \theta - \cos \theta '} = \pi \frac{sin(n\theta ')}{sin \theta '}
\end{equation}

The integral becomes: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{U_\infty}{\pi} \left[ A_0.0 + A_0. \pi - \frac{\pi}{2} \sum _n A_n \frac{\sin [(n+1)\theta '] - \sin [(n-1)\theta ']}{\sin \theta '} \right] = U_\infty \left[ A_0 - \sum _n A_n \cos (n\theta ') \right]
\end{equation}

where we used the Simpson equation. The \eqref{eq:2.61} becomes: 

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\begin{equation}
		A_0 - \sum _n A_n \cos (n\theta ') = \alpha - \left( \frac{dz}{dx} \right)'
		\end{equation}
	}
\end{center}

This equation must be valid $\forall P$ on the airfoil. To find the coefficients $A_i$, let's integrate first this for $0\leq \theta ' \leq \pi$ in order to compute $A_0$: 

\begin{equation}
A_0\pi - \cancel{\sum _n A_n \int _0 ^\pi \cos (n\theta ')d\theta '} = \alpha\pi - \int _0 ^\pi \frac{dz}{dx}d\theta\qquad \Rightarrow A_0 = \alpha - \frac{1}{\pi} \int _0^\pi \frac{dz}{dx}\, d\theta.
\end{equation}

For the $A_n$, we multiply the same equation by $\cos (m\theta ')$ before integrating (we will drop the '). Let's see that $\int _0 ^\pi \cos (n\theta)\cos (m\theta) d\theta = 0$ if $ m \neq n $ and $= \pi /2$ if $n = m$. We finally get:

\begin{equation}
A_n = \frac{2}{\pi} \int _0 ^\pi \frac{dz}{dx} \cos (m\theta) \, d\theta .
\end{equation}

We can note that for $A_n$ only the camber plays a role, the angle of attack does not appear. Only $A_0$ is influenced by $\alpha$. We are now able to compute any vorticity distribution $\gamma (\theta)$, for example for a flat plate $A_n = 0$ and $A_0 = \alpha$. 

\subsection{How is the Kutta-Youkowski condition imposed (allowing to compute the lift)}

The above respects the Kutta condition that states that there is no vortex allowed on the trailing edge. Indeed, $\gamma (\pi) = 0$  which means no contribution by vortex. We can also state that at the leading edge, the stagnation point is in the pressure side at the front. Indeed, for $\theta = 0$, $\coth \theta = \infty = \gamma (\pi )$ which means that we have a singularity at the TE and that the velocity is infinite due to the turning on the LE. 

\subsection{Starting from the expressions for the Fourier coefficients, compute the	circulation and lift coefficient as a function of angle of attack, explain the result}

\subsubsection{Calculation of the total circulation}

To get $\Gamma$ we only have to compute the integral over the whole airfoil:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Gamma &= \int _0 ^c \gamma (x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} c \int _0 ^c \gamma (\theta ) \sin \theta \, d\theta \\
& = \frac{1}{2} c \left[ 2U_\infty \int _0 ^\pi A_0 (1+\cos\theta) \, d\theta + 2U_\infty \sum _{n=1}^\infty \int _0^\pi A_n \sin (n\theta)\sin \theta \, d\theta  \right] \\
&= U_\infty  c \left[  A_0 \pi  + 2U_\infty + \int _0^\pi \sin ^2(\theta) \, d\theta - \frac{1}{2} \sum _{n=2}^\infty \cancel{\int _0^\pi A_n \cos [(n+1)\theta - \cos (n-1)\theta ] \, d\theta } \right] \\
&= U_\infty c [A_0 \pi + A_1 \pi /2].
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We see that the circulation only depends on two coefficients. 

\subsubsection{Calculation of the lift coefficient}
We can now compute the lift using the kutta formula $L = \rho _\infty U_\infty \Gamma$. We are interested in the $c_l$ and not the lift itself. In 2D we have to divide by the chord so: 

\begin{equation}
c_l = \frac{L}{\frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty U_\infty ^2 C} = \frac{2\Gamma}{U_\infty c} = \pi (2A_0 + A_1)
\label{eq:2.70}
\end{equation}

We can now replace by definition of the coefficients: 

\begin{equation}
c_l = 2\pi\left(\alpha - \underbrace{\frac{1}{\pi} \int _0^\pi \frac{dz}{dx} (1-\cos \theta)\, d\theta}_{\alpha _0} \right) = 2\pi (\alpha - \alpha _0)
\label{eq:2.71}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha _0$ is the \textbf{zero lift angle of attack}. We see that we have a linear relation with respect to $\alpha$. We have the theoretical model the same for every profile, only $\alpha _0$ changes with the profile. Remark that the lift is also the integral of the pressure on the lower and upper side:

\begin{equation}
L = \int _0 ^c (p_l - p_u) \, dx = \rho _\infty U_\infty \int _0 ^c \gamma \, dx \qquad \Rightarrow p_l - p_u = \rho _\infty U_\infty \gamma (x).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Starting from the expression for the momentum coefficient at the leading edge $c_m$(LE), show that it’s a linear function of the lift coefficient $c_l$}


\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{l}{4.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{ch2/34}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
The contribution of the elementary parts of the airfoil gives:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&dM_{LE} = - (\Delta p \, dx) x \\ 
\Rightarrow &M_{LE} = -\int _0 ^c \Delta p x \, dx = - \rho _\infty U_\infty \int _0^c \gamma x \, dx
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

After some manipulations (not detailed):

\begin{equation}
c_{m_{LE}} = \frac{M_{LE}}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _\infty U_\infty ^2 c^2} = - \frac{\pi}{4} (2A_0 + 2A_1 - A_2) = -\frac{1}{4} c_l - \frac{\pi}{4} (A_1 - A_2)
\end{equation}

where we used \eqref{eq:2.70} for the last expression.

\subsection{Compute the location of the aerodynamic center AC and the momentum coefficient in the aerodynamic center}

\begin{wrapfigure}[6]{l}{4.5cm}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{ch2/35}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{wrapfigure}
The moment on the LE is related to the moment anywhere:

\begin{equation}
M_{LE} = M_{ac} - x_{ac} L \qquad \Rightarrow c_{m_{LE}} =c_{m_{ac}} - \frac{x_{ac}}{c}c_{l} 
\end{equation}

We have: 

\begin{equation}
c_{m_{ac}} = \left( \frac{x_{ac}}{c} - \frac{1}{4} \right) c_l - \frac{\pi}{4} (A_1 -A_2).
\end{equation}

We see that, for this relation to be independent of the angle of attack, we must have $x_{ac} = \frac{c}{4}$ so that: 

\begin{equation}
c_{m_{ac}} = \frac{\pi}{4} (A_2 - A_1).
\label{eq:2.77}
\end{equation}

Remark that for symmetrical wings $\frac{dz}{dx} = 0 \Rightarrow A_1 = A_2 = 0 \Rightarrow c_{m_{ac}} = 0$. 

\subsection{Compute the location of the center of pressure}

We replace ac by cp in aerodynamic center equation, and since the moment should be null at this point:

\begin{equation}
c_{m_{cp}} = c_{m_{LE}} + \frac{x_{cp}}{c} c_l = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \frac{x_{cp}}{c} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\frac{\pi}{4}(A_1-A_2)}{c_l} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{c_{m_{ac}}}{c_l}.
\end{equation}

Some remarks: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] the center of pressure is not fixed and varies with the lift
	\item[•] at 0 lift, $x_{cp}\rightarrow \infty$ (for symmetric wing $x_{cp} = x_{ac} = c/4$ fixed)
	\item[•] cp always downstream to ac because $c_{m_{ac}}<0$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Computation of inviscid irrotational flow around a thin airfoil based on a	continuous distribution of vortices}
\paragraph{Discuss the influence of a flap located at the trailing edge of the airfoil}
	According to the definition of the zero lift angle in \eqref{eq:2.71}, the effect of the shape becomes greater when $\theta \approx 180\degres$ (trailing edge). By making the zero lift angle more negative we can produce more lift before the critical angle of attack that decreases a bit.
	
		\begin{wrapfigure}[6]{r}{3.5cm}
		\vspace{-5mm}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{ch2/37}
		\captionof{figure}{}
	\end{wrapfigure}
	The effect is evaluated by taking a flat plate as camber line with a deflection near the TE, starting at E\% of the chord and slope $\eta$. E in function of $\theta _E$ is: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	E = \frac{1}{2} (1+\cos \theta _E).
	\end{equation}	 
	
	In this case, $A_0$ and $A_n$ can be rewritten as:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	&A_0 = \alpha - \frac{1}{\pi} \int _0 ^\pi \frac{dz}{dx} d\theta \approx \alpha - \frac{\eta}{\pi} (\pi - \theta _E) \\
	&A_n = \frac{2}{\pi} \int _0 ^\pi \frac{dz}{dx} \cos (n\theta )d\theta \approx -\frac{2\eta}{\pi} \frac{1}{n} \sin (n\theta _E)
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	
	such that the lift coefficient becomes: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	c_l = \pi (2A_0 + A_1) = \underbrace{2\pi \alpha}_{\mbox{without flaps}} \underbrace{- 2\eta (\pi - \theta _E + \sin \theta)}_{\Delta c_l > 0 \mbox{ since } \eta < 0}.
	\end{equation}
	
	This seams to be like $c_l = 2\pi (\alpha - \alpha _0)$ allowing the definition for the zero lift angle: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	\alpha _0 = \frac{\eta}{\pi} (\pi - \theta _E + \sin \theta)
	\end{equation}
	
	which indicates an increase (decrease since $\eta <0$) of $\alpha _0$ since it is null for the flat plate. For the moment at the ac \eqref{eq:2.77}
	
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta c_{m_{ac}} = \frac{\eta }{2} \sin \theta _E (1- \cos \theta _E)
	\end{equation}
	
	which also indicates a decrease in the momentum which is 0 for the symmetric wing.
\paragraph{Determine the effect of the flap on:}
\begin{description}
	\item[the lift curve:] from the above, we see that lift goes up with flaps
	\item[the zero lift angle of attack:] It is increased, see above
	\item[the moment at the aerodynamic center:] It decreases.

\section{3D wing theory}

\subsection{Explain mean chord, span, aspect ratio, taper, sweep of wing}
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{ch3/1}
		\captionof{figure}{}	
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch3/2}
		\captionof{figure}{}	
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
The \textbf{span} is the total distance between the tips of the wings, plane body included. It is a straight line.\\
The \textbf{mean chord} is defined by dividing the wing area by the span. This is used to avoid having a chord that varies for calculations.\\
The \textbf{aspect ratio} is the span divided  by the mean chord, or the span squared divided by the wing surface. Higher aspect ration means higher lift to drag ratio.\\
\textbf{Tapered wings} are wing that have a bigger chord near the body. The \textbf{taper ratio} is defined by $\frac{c_{tip}}{c_{root}}$\\
\textbf{Swept wings} are wings that are (at least partially) not $\perp$ to the flow. This is to delay shock wave formation. The sweep is the angle of the leading and/or trailing edge compared to the $\perp$ to the flow.

\subsection{Explain downwash effect, downwash angle, effective angle of attack, total and induced drag}
\wrapfig{7}{l}{6.5}{0.1}{ch3/3}{fig:3.3}
Finite span $\Rightarrow$the pressure on both side must be equal at the end of the span. This means that the pressure on the upper side must increase when going to the tip, and decrease on the lower side. This creates a pressure gradient between the root and the tip. This gradient will push the streamlines on the upper side towards the fuselage and towards the tip on the lower side. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{ch3/4}
		\captionof{figure}{}	
		\label{fig:3.4}
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{ch3/5}
		\captionof{figure}{}	
		\label{fig:3.5}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Looking from downstream, this discontinuity in velocity induces an infinite series of infinitely small vortices, clockwise on the left and anti clockwise on the right wing (\autoref{fig:3.4}), resulting in 2 discrete vortices at the tip, the s\textbf{wong-tip vortices or trailing vortices} (\autoref{fig:3.5}). 

\wrapfig{7}{l}{6.5}{0.08}{ch3/6}{fig:3.6}
These vortices induce a \textbf{downward velocity component, the downwash} $\vec{w}$. This component superposes on the incoming flow and changes the angle of attack (\autoref{fig:3.6}). The angle of change is the \textbf{downwash angle}, or induced angle of attack and we compute the \textbf{effective angle of attack} $\alpha _{eff} = \alpha - \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is the induced angle of attack.

The decrease of $\alpha$ means a decrease in liftas the new lift is perpendicular to the new flow, some oof it's force produces an \textbf{induced drag}.

The \textbf{total drag $C_D$} is computed as being the sum of the profil drag and the induced one. (in reality, we also have to take into account the parasite drags created by the fuselage, antennas,...)

\subsection{Starting from the given expression for the downwash angle, compute the induced drag force and the induced drag coefficient}

\begin{equation}
\alpha _{eff} = \alpha - \epsilon
\end{equation}

\textbf{induced drag}: 

\begin{equation}
D_i = L \sin \alpha _i \approx L\alpha _i \qquad with \qquad \alpha _i = \frac{C_L}{\pi e AR} 
\label{eq:3.2}
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{10}{r}{5.5}{0.1}{ch3/7}{fig:3.7}
where $e$ is the \textbf{span efficiency factor or Oswald's efficiency factor} $0.85<e<1$. We get the Drag coefficient:

\begin{equation}
C_{D_i} =  \frac{C_L^2}{\pi e AR} .
\end{equation}

\subsection{Explain the lift curve as a function of the angle of attack for a 3D wing, compare with the lift curve for a 2D profile}
The theoretical lift curve can be obtained based on the 2D wing as \autoref{fig:3.7}. We can see that the 3D wing lift for a certain $\alpha$ corresponds to the 2D lift for the effective angle of attack $\alpha - \epsilon$. The induced angle of attack decreases with lift, at $\alpha _0$ the two curve are on the same point. Algebraically the 2D and 3D curves can be noted:

\begin{equation}
c_l = m(\alpha - \alpha _0), \qquad C_L = m(\alpha - \epsilon - \alpha _0) = m^* (\alpha - \alpha _0)
\label{eq:3.4}
\end{equation}

where $m^*$ is the slope of the 3D lift. We can isolate this and find that:

\begin{equation}
m^* = m\left( 1 - \frac{\epsilon}{\alpha - \alpha _0} \right) = \frac{m}{1+\frac{m}{\pi e AR}} 
\end{equation}

where we used the definition \eqref{eq:3.2} and \eqref{eq:3.4} for the last result. We see that the slope is independent from $\alpha$. 

\subsection{Give the expression for the total drag coefficient as a function of $C_L$}

The total drag is the sum of the profile drag and the induced one:

\begin{equation}
C_D = C_{D_0} + kC_L^2 + C_{D_i} = C_{D_0} + C_L^2 \left( k + \frac{1}{\pi e AR}\right)
\end{equation}	 

where $k$ is generally small compared to the other. 

\wrapfig{8}{l}{5.5}{0.08}{ch3/8}{fig:3.8}
With these formulas we can plot the characteristics in 3D. We can note that the maximum lift does not change so more, but there is a strong decrease in the maximum glide ratio, $C_D$ increases with $C_L$ so $\alpha$. Finally we note an increase of the stall angle but in practice this is not as large as predicted. This means also that the maximum lift decreases slightly with decreasing AR. No significant difference for the moment. 

\wrapfig{5}{l}{5}{0.1}{ch3/9}{fig:3.9}
To avoid the adverse effect which is increasing induced drag. We can use high AR or add winglet on the tip, a kind of end plate that forces a vertical diffusion of the tip vortex, reducing drag. They have to be carefully designed to not increase the viscous drag. 

\subsection{Give the expression of the drag force D as a function of the velocity at infinity}

Let's compute the total drag using the coefficient definition:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
D &= C_D \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty v_\infty ^2 S = C_{D_0} \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty v_\infty ^2 S + \left(k +\frac{1}{\pi e AR} \right)\frac{L^2}{( \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty v_\infty ^2 S)^2} \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty v_\infty ^2 S \\
&= k_1 v_\infty ^2 + k_2 v_\infty^2.
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:3.7}
\end{equation}

\section{3D wing theory – Derivation of Prandtl lifting line method. Give the basic ideas and the development of Prandtl’s lifting line theory}

\subsection{Velocity induced by a vortex filament}
\wrapfig{6}{l}{7}{0.12}{ch3/11}{fig:3.11}
The seen free vortex is characterized by circular streamlines around a certain point P. In this point the vorticity is concentrated such that the circulation around the contours that don't contain the point are null. If we consider several planes above each other containing a 2D free vortex, the point P form a line called \textbf{vortex line or vortex filament}. The circulation on each point of that line have the same circulation.

\wrapfig{6}{l}{6.5}{0.06}{ch3/13}{fig:3.13}
This line can be a random line with bending. Now if one places an infinite number of vortex lines besides each other, we get a \textbf{vortex sheet}.

The normal component of the velocity is continuous while the tangential one varies as $ \Delta v_t = \gamma $ with gamma given by the circulation around a vortex sheet.

\wrapfig{10}{l}{5}{0.1}{ch3/14}{fig:3.14}
Using Bio-Savart at point P:

\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = \frac{\Gamma }{4\pi}\int _{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{d\vec{l}\times r}{|r|^3}.
\end{equation}

We have: $d\vec{l} \times \vec{r} = Rdl \vec{1}_n$ , $\vec{v} = v \vec{1}_n$ (see figure). Let's define the length $l$ beginning from the piercing point on the surface until the $d\vec{l}$. We can graphically see that: 

\begin{equation}
l  = -R \coth \theta \Rightarrow dl = \frac{R}{\sin ^2\theta} d\theta, \qquad r = \frac{R}{\sin \theta} 
\end{equation}

Replacing all this we get:

\begin{equation}
v = \frac{\Gamma}{4\pi} \int _{0}^{\pi} \frac{R^2}{\sin^2 \theta } \frac{\sin ^3 \theta}{R^3} d\theta \qquad \Rightarrow v = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi R}.
\end{equation}

This is the velocity distribution of the 2D free vortex.  

\subsection{Helmholtz theorems, Biot-Savart law}
\begin{center}
	\theor{\textbf{Helmholtz theorems}\\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[•] Along a vortex line, the circulation must be constant.
			\item[•] A vortex line cannot finish in the flow but must continue to the edges of the flow or form a closed contour. 
		\end{itemize}
	}
\end{center}

\wrapfig{6}{r}{4}{0.1}{ch3/12}{fig:3.12}
This law gives the induced velocity in a certain point P cause by an elementary piece $d\vec{l}$ of the filament: 

\theor{
	\textbf{Law of Biot-Savart}
	\begin{equation}
	d\vec{v} = \frac{\Gamma }{4\pi} \frac{d\vec{l}\times r}{|r|^3}
	\end{equation}
}

\ \\ With analogy to electrical wire where we have a current intensity that induces a magnetic field on point P: $d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu I }{4\pi} \frac{d\vec{l}\times r}{|r|^3}$.
\subsection{Circulation around a vortex sheet}
 For the total circulation to be finite, the circulations must be infinitely small, but can vary from one line to the other. The circulation of the vortex sheet is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \int _a ^b d\Gamma = \gamma \, ds
\end{equation}

\subsection{Downwash velocity induced by a single horseshoe vortex, why this model for a wing is not working}

\wrapfig{10}{l}{7}{0.08}{ch3/15}{fig:3.15}
The idea is to represent the 3D wing by means of vortex filaments. On the figure we have the \textbf{horseshoe vortex} where the x direction continues to infinity to satisfy the Helmholtz condition and the y direction extends from $-b/2$ to $b/2$ and represents the two wings. This last is the bound vortex and the one in x direction represents the tip vortices. The problem with the representation is that we have a constant circulation while we have seen that the lift decreases when going to the tips. 

\wrapfig{10}{r}{5}{0.1}{ch3/16}{fig:3.16}
Let's try to compute the downwash velocity on a point from the bound vortex. The law of Biot-Savart has 3 contributions: 

\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = \int _{-\infty} ^{-b/2} \dots + \int _{-b/2} ^{b/2} \dots + \int _{b/2}^{\infty}.
\end{equation}

The second integral vanishes as dl and r are parallel, the two others were computed at the previous section. Pay attention that we have to take half the contribution as the integral is not $-\infty,+\infty$:

\begin{equation}
\vec{v}(y) = \left(\frac{\Gamma}{4\pi R} + \frac{\Gamma}{4\pi R^*} \right) \vec{1}_n
\end{equation}

We can see that the velocity is infinity at the tips and minimum at the middle. This is clearly not the reality.

\subsection{Downwash velocity induced by a superposition of horseshoe vortices}
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch3/17}
		\captionof{figure}{}	
		\label{fig:3.17}
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.12]{ch3/18}
		\captionof{figure}{}	
		\label{fig:3.18}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}

The solution is to superpose the horseshoes with bound vortices with different length (fig:\autoref{fig:3.17}). If now we let tend the number of superimposed horseshoe vortices to infinity, we will get a vortex sheet as represented on \autoref{fig:3.18}. The continuously varying circulation on the wing is no longer constant and this corresponds better with the reality. 

\wrapfig{10}{l}{5}{0.08}{ch3/19}{fig:3.19}
Consider this figure, we will try to compute the downwash velocity by considering a large but finite number of vortices of circulation $d \Gamma$ for each. We have 3 regions to consider with our basic formula:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] $y<0$: $d\vec{v}(y_0) =  \frac{d \Gamma}{4\pi (y_0-y)}\vec{1}_n$
	\item[•] $0<y<y_0$: $d\vec{v}(y_0) = \frac{d \Gamma}{4\pi (y_0-y)}\vec{1}_N = \frac{-d \Gamma}{4\pi (y_0-y)}\vec{1}_n$
	\item[•] $y_0<y$: $d\vec{v}(y_0) =  \frac{d \Gamma}{4\pi (y-y_0)}\vec{1}_n = \frac{-d \Gamma}{4\pi (y_0-y)}\vec{1}_n$  
\end{itemize}

We can see that the three formulas are the same if we take $\Gamma < 0$ for $y>0$. We can so write the total contribution and its extension to the infinite number of lines:

\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = \left[ \sum \frac{d\Gamma}{4\pi (y_0 - y)} \right] = \left[ \int _{-b/2}^{b/2} \frac{d\Gamma}{4\pi (y_0 - y)} \right]
\end{equation}


\subsection{Derivation of Prandtl’s fundamental equation of lifting line theory}
\wrapfig{10}{l}{5}{0.15}{ch3/20}{fig:3.20}
The induced angle of attack is then given by:

\begin{equation}
\tan \alpha _i \approx \alpha _i = \frac{v(y_0)}{v_\infty} = \frac{1}{4\pi v_\infty} \int _{-b/2} ^{b/2}\frac{d\Gamma}{y_0-y}.
\label{eq:3.18}
\end{equation}

Now let's denote $\alpha _{eff} = \alpha - \epsilon$. We know that the theory says $c_l = 2\pi (\alpha _{eff}(y_0)- \alpha _0(y_0))$, and using the definition of $c_l$ and the Kutta-Jukowski for $L(y_0)$ we get:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}	
&c_l = \frac{L(y_0)}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_\infty v_\infty ^2 c(y_0)} = \frac{\rho _\infty v_\infty \Gamma (y_0)}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_\infty v_\infty ^2 c(y_0)} = \frac{\Gamma (y_0)}{\frac{1}{2}v_\infty ^2 c(y_0)} \\
&\Rightarrow \alpha _{eff} = \frac{\Gamma (y_0)}{\pi v_\infty c(y_0)} + \alpha _0(y_0)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Combining all the result, we can compute the $\alpha$: 

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Fundamental equation of Prandtl's lifting line theory}
		\begin{equation}
		\alpha(y_0) = \frac{\Gamma (y_0)}{\pi v_\infty c(y_0)} + \alpha _0(y_0) + \frac{1}{4\pi v_\infty} \int _{-b/2}^{b/2} \frac{d\Gamma}{y_0 - y}. 
		\end{equation}		
	}
\end{center}

The only unknown in this equation is the circulation: several cases.

\section{3D wing theory: application of Prandtl lifting line theory for a wing with given circulation. Starting from Prandtl’s fundamental equation of lifting line theory and the formula for the induced angle of attack:}
\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Fundamental equation of Prandtl's lifting line theory}
		\begin{equation}
		\alpha(y_0) = \frac{\Gamma (y_0)}{\pi v_\infty c(y_0)} + \alpha _0(y_0) + \frac{1}{4\pi v_\infty} \int _{-b/2}^{b/2} \frac{d\Gamma}{y_0 - y}. 
		\end{equation}		
	}

\begin{equation}
\tan \alpha _i \approx \alpha _i = \frac{v(y_0)}{v_\infty} = \frac{1}{4\pi v_\infty} \int _{-b/2} ^{b/2}\frac{d\Gamma}{y_0-y}.
\label{eq:3.18}
\end{equation}


\end{center}

\subsection{Discuss the different terms of the equation}
$\Gamma$ is the circulation around the vortex sheet, $v_\infty$ the flow speed, $c(y_0)$ the point where we calculate the downwash,$y$ the position of a vortex wire. (see graphs above)

\subsection{Apply to a wing with a given circulation distribution: find lift and drag coefficients}

Idea is to solve the integral. The discussions below do it for more complicated case, so good luck!

\subsection{Apply to a wing with a given shape and unknown circulation distribution defined by a truncated Fourier series and compute the lift $C_L$ and the induced drag $C_{Di}$ coefficients}

Local and total lift by:

\begin{equation}
L'(y_0) = \rho _\infty v_\infty \Gamma (y_0) \qquad L = \int _{-b/2}^{b/2} L'(y)\, dy
\end{equation}

and the local and total induced drag: 

\begin{equation}
D'_i (y_0) = \Gamma (y_0) \epsilon (y_0) \qquad D_i = \int _{-b/2}^{b/2} D_i'(y)\, dy
\end{equation}

We assume a serie:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \sum _{n=1} ^N A_n \sin (n\theta).
\end{equation}

Substitution of this in the Prandtl's fundamental equation gives:

\begin{equation}
\alpha (\theta _0) = \frac{1}{\pi v_\infty c(\theta _0)} \sum _n A_n \sin (n\theta_0) + \alpha_0(\theta _0) + \frac{1}{2\pi v_\infty b} \sum _n A_n n \int ^0_\pi \frac{\cos (n\theta)d\theta}{\cos \theta _0 - \cos \theta}
\label{eq:3.32}
\end{equation}

$\rightarrow$ Glauert integral. We can find a solution by considering N equations for N points distributed along the span.

By integration of the local lift and definition of $C_L$ and $C_D$:
\begin{equation}
C_L = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}v_\infty S} \int _{-b/2}^{b/2} \Gamma (y) \, dy = \frac{b}{u_\infty S} \sum _n \int _0 ^\pi A_n \sin (n\theta) \sin \theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi b A_1}{2Sv_\infty}. 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C_{D_i} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} v_\infty S} \int _{-b/2} ^{b/2} \Gamma (y)\alpha _i \, dy. 
\end{equation}

Using \eqref{eq:3.18}, we can express $\alpha _i (\theta _0)$ as:

\begin{equation}
\alpha _i (\theta _0) = \frac{1}{2\pi v_\infty b} \int ^{0}_{\pi} \frac{\frac{d\Gamma }{d\theta}}{\cos \theta _0 - \cos \theta} \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2\sin \theta _0 v_\infty b} \sum _n A_n n \sin (n \theta _0)
\end{equation}

which gives:

\begin{equation}
C_{D_i} = \frac{1}{2v_\infty ^2 S} \int _0 ^\pi \sum _n \sum _k A_n A_k \sin (n\theta) \sin (k\theta) \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{4v_\infty ^2 S} \sum _n A_n ^2 n
\end{equation}

and using the lift coefficient:

\begin{equation}
C_{D_i} = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi AR}  \left(1+\sum _{n=2} n \left(\frac{A_n}{A_1}\right)^2 \right) \qquad \Rightarrow e = \frac{1}{1+\sum _{n=2} n \left(\frac{A_n}{A_1}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{1+\delta}
\end{equation}

where $\delta $ is the \textbf{induced drag factor}, since it is always positive, $e<1$.

Same 2D profile along the span and no twist. Because of the symmetry, it is obvious that the pair n in the series will have no contribution. Let's go until 7:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma = A_1\sin \theta + A_3\sin 3\theta + A_5\sin 5\theta + A_7\sin 7\theta.
\end{equation}

To determine the coefficient we have to apply \eqref{eq:3.32} to 4 points. Let's take half the span because of symmetry: $\theta = \pi /8, \pi /4, 3\pi /8, \pi /2$. Since the 2D profile is constant, $\alpha _0$ is independent of $\theta$, same for $\alpha$ since there are no twist. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch3/23}

		\includegraphics[scale=0.12]{ch3/24}
		\captionof{figure}{}	
		\label{fig:3.24}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}

After some calculation one find a circulation distribution as in \autoref{fig:3.23}, where $\lambda$ is defined such that $c_t = (1- \lambda) c_r$. $\lambda = 0$ corresponds to a rectangular wing and $\lambda = 1$ is the triangular one. Note that the figure also represents the lift. The lift coefficient no, because it becomes larger at the tips due to $c\searrow$. On \autoref{fig:3.24} is represented the induced drag coefficient $\delta$. We see that it is always possible to find the taper ratio to have the minimum drag. Most of the planes use tapered wings since it is more simple to produce than elliptic wing.

\subsection{Assume an elliptic distribution for the circulation. Show that the platform of the wing must be an ellipse.}

The elliptic circulation distribution is written:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma (y) = \Gamma (y_0) \sqrt{1-\left( \frac{y}{b/2} \right)^2}.
\end{equation}

where $\Gamma _0$ is the circulation in the plane of symmetry. Let's compute the velocity:

\begin{equation}
v(y_0) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int _{-b/2}^{b/2} \frac{d\Gamma }{y_0 - y} = \frac{\Gamma _0}{2b} = cst \qquad \Rightarrow \epsilon = \alpha _i = \frac{v(y_0)}{v_\infty} = \frac{\Gamma _0}{2b v_\infty} = cst.
\end{equation}

where we used the transformation $y = b/2 \cos \theta$. Induced angle of attack is constant along the span.

\begin{equation}
L'(y) = \rho v_\infty \sqrt{1-\left( \frac{y}{b/2} \right)^2}.
\end{equation}

On the other hand we can use \eqref{eq:3.4} to express the lift as: 

\begin{equation}
L'(y) = m (\alpha - \alpha _i - \alpha _0) \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty v_\infty ^2 c
\end{equation}

Combining the equations we get: 

\begin{equation}
(\alpha - \alpha _i - \alpha _0) c = \frac{2\Gamma _0}{v_\infty} \sqrt{1-\left( \frac{y}{b/2}\right)^2}. 
\end{equation}

Note that if the left hand side is constant, the equation is satisfied for an \textbf{elliptic platform}. Since $\alpha _i$ is already constant, the whole term is constant only if the geometric angle of attack is constant and the profile does not change along the span. Since $C_{d_i} = C_L \alpha _i$, we can make the same analysis for the drag. \\

On the other hand, if the platform is non elliptic, since m varies little, the different angles must vary too. This is done by introducing a \textbf{twist} in the wing so that $\alpha$ varies. The lift coefficient is obtained by integration of the local lift:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}\rho v_\infty ^2 S} \int _{-b/2}^{b/2} L'(y) \, dy = \frac{\Gamma _0\pi b}{2v_\infty S} = \frac{\Gamma _0 \pi}{2bv_\infty} AR.
\end{equation}

Combination of this and what we found for $\alpha _i$ in this section we get:

\begin{equation}
\alpha _i = \frac{C_L}{\pi AR}
\end{equation}

which is what we defined at the beginning of the chapter but for $e =1$ (span efficiency factor). The induced drag is given by:

\begin{equation}
D_i'(y) = L'(y) \alpha _i \qquad \Rightarrow C_{D_i} = C_L \alpha _i = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi AR}.
\end{equation}

\section{2D airfoil compressible flow around an airfoil using the small perturbation approach}

\subsection{Derive the compressible potential equation / Derive the equation governing compressible potential equation, what are the assumptions}

Remind that we have defined a potential function to describe incompressible flows, conservation of mass giving:

\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = \nabla \phi \qquad \frac{\D u}{\D x} + \frac{\D v}{\D y} = 0 = \frac{\D^2 \phi}{\D x^2} + \frac{\D^2 \phi}{\D y^2}.
\end{equation}

This can also be used to describe compressible flows, conservation of mass is then: 

\begin{equation}
\rho (\phi _{xx} + \phi _{yy}) + \rho _x \phi _x + \rho _y \phi _y = 0
\label{eq:6.2}
\end{equation}

where we introduced the shorthand notation $\frac{\D a}{\D x} = a_x$. We assume that the flow is isentropic, this is satisfied by inviscid flows (no shock  wave): 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\rho}{T^{\frac{1}{\gamma -1}}} = cst \qquad \Rightarrow \frac{d \rho}{\rho} = \frac{1}{\gamma -1} \frac{dT}{T}
\end{equation}

if the flow does not work (turbine), the temperature is constant and the equation becomes:

\begin{equation}
d\rho = -\frac{\rho}{2a^2} d(u^2+v^2).
\end{equation}

If we replace the velocities we get: 

\begin{equation}
\rho _x = -\frac{\rho}{a^2} (\phi _x \phi _{xx} + \phi _y \phi _{xy}) \qquad \rho _y = -\frac{\rho}{a^2} (\phi _x \phi _{xy} + \phi _y \phi _{yy}).
\end{equation}		

That we can substitute in \eqref{eq:6.2}:

\begin{equation}
\left( 1-\frac{1}{a^2} \phi^2_x \right) \phi _{xx} + \left( 1-\frac{1}{a^2 }\phi^2_y \right) \phi _{yy} - \frac{2}{a^2} \phi_x \phi_y \phi _{xy} = 0.
\label{eq:6.6}
\end{equation}	


\subsection{Assume a thin airfoil at small angle of attack: derive the linearized potential equation. What is the range of validity as a function of the free stream Mach number / Derive the equation in the case of small perturbations. What are the assumptions for this equation to be valid ?}

If the far field velocity profile is $u= V_\infty$, we can note the velocity field by means of perturbations: $u = V_\infty + \hat{u}, v = \hat{v}$. A perturbation potential function can be defined: 

\begin{equation}
\phi = V_\infty x + \hat{\phi}\qquad with \qquad \hat{\phi} _x = \hat{u}, \quad \hat{\phi}_y = \hat{v}. 
\end{equation}

By substitution of this in \eqref{eq:6.6}:

\begin{equation}
\left[ a^2- (V_\infty + \hat{\phi} _x )^2 \right] \hat{\phi} _{xx} + \left[ a^2-\hat{\phi}_y ^2 \right] \hat{\phi} _{yy} - 2 (V_\infty + \hat{\phi} _x) \hat{\phi}_y \hat{\phi} _{xy} = 0.
\label{eq:6.8}
\end{equation}

Since the total temperature is constant:

\begin{equation}
\frac{a^2_\infty}{\gamma -1} + \frac{V_\infty ^2}{2} = \frac{a^2}{\gamma -1} + \frac{(V_\infty + \hat{u}) ^2 = \hat{v}^2}{2} 
\label{eq:6.9}
\end{equation}

If we make the assumption of small perturbation, the quadratic terms cancel and \eqref{eq:6.8} and \eqref{eq:6.9} become:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{a^2_\infty}{a^2} = 1 - (\gamma -1) \frac{\hat{u}}{V_\infty} M^2_\infty\\
&\left[ a^2- V^2_\infty + 2V_\infty \hat{u}  \right] \hat{\phi} _{xx} + a^2 \hat{\phi} _{yy} - 2 V_\infty \hat{v} \hat{\phi} _{xy} = 0 \\ 
\Rightarrow 
&\left[ 1- M_\infty^2 - (\gamma + 1) M_\infty \frac{\hat{u}}{V_\infty} \right] \hat{\phi} _{xx} + \left[ 1 - (\gamma -1 )M_\infty ^2\frac{\hat{u}}{V_\infty} \right] \hat{\phi} _{yy} - 2 M^2_\infty \frac{\hat{v}}{V_\infty} \hat{\phi} _{xy} = 0 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where the last expression is obtained by dividing by $a^2_\infty$ and replacing. By considering again the small perturbation ($V_\infty \ll$) equation we get the:

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Transonic smal perturbation potential equation}
		\begin{equation}
		\left[ (1-M_\infty ^2) - (\gamma +1) M^2_\infty \frac{\hat{\phi}_x}{V_\infty}  \right] \hat{\phi} _{xx} + \hat{\phi} _{yy} = 0.
		\end{equation}
	}
\end{center}

We can see that the $\hat{u}$ appears in $\hat{\phi} _{xx}$ term, this is no longer negligible for \textbf{sonic} velocities. For sub- and super-sonic flows however the equation simplifies in: 

\begin{equation}
(1-M_\infty ^2) \hat{\phi} _{xx} + \hat{\phi} _{yy} = 0.
\end{equation}

Note that we retrieve our incompressible equation for $M_\infty \rightarrow 0$. Be aware that this last relation is only valid for small perturbations (small bodies in practice) and sub- or super-sonic flows ($M_\infty > 1.2, M_\infty < 0.8$). \\

Let's now operate a change of coordinate $(x,y) \rightarrow (\xi , \eta)$, recalling $1-M_\infty ^2 \equiv \beta ^2$: 

\begin{equation}
\xi = x \quad \eta = \beta y \qquad \bar{\phi} (\xi , \eta) = m .\hat{\phi}(x,y)
\end{equation}

where m is a constant. Let's find the expression of $\bar{\phi} (\xi, \eta)$. The chain rule gives: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\phi} _x = \hat{\phi}_\xi = \frac{1}{m} \bar{\phi} _\xi \qquad  \hat{\phi} _y = \frac{\beta}{m} \bar{\phi}_\eta &\qquad \hat{\phi} _{xx} = \frac{1}{m} \bar{\phi}_{\xi \xi} \qquad \hat{\phi} _{yy} = \frac{\beta ^2}{m} \bar{\phi}_{\eta \eta}\\
&\Rightarrow \bar{\phi}_{xx} + \bar{\phi}_{yy} = 0
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:6.14}
\end{equation}

We can see that the compressible flow in $(x,y)$ is reduced to an incompressible flow in the $(\xi, \eta)$ plane. Pay attention that $\bar{\phi}$ describes the perturbation velocities $\bar{u}, \bar{v}$. in the $(\xi, \eta)$ plane.  

\wrapfig{7}{l}{7.5}{0.1}{ch6/9}{fig:6.9}
We can now focus on the shape of the profile in the new axis. Let's analyze the tangent to the profile by defining the angle $\theta$ for the profile in (x,y). Under the assumption of small perturbation (thin airfoil), we can see that:

\begin{equation}
\tan \theta \approx \theta = \frac{\hat{v}}{V_\infty + \hat{u}} \approx \frac{\hat{v}}{V_\infty} = \frac{1}{V_\infty} \hat{\phi} _y \qquad \Rightarrow \chi \approx \frac{1}{V_\infty} \bar{\phi} _\eta
\end{equation}

where the analogy for the new plane is done. Using \eqref{eq:6.14}, we get: 

\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{\beta}{m} \chi.
\end{equation}

Let's investigate two cases: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] If we choose $m=\beta$, $\theta = \chi$, the two profiles are identical. We have for the velocity: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	\hat{u} = \hat{\phi} _x = \frac{\bar{\phi}_\xi}{\beta} = \frac{\bar{u}}{\beta}
	\end{equation}
	
	and since the pressure coefficient is given by $C_p = -\frac{2\hat{u}}{V_\infty}$: 
\end{itemize}		

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Prandtl-Glauert rule}
		\begin{equation}
		C_p = \frac{C_{p,inc}}{\beta} = \frac{C_{p,inc}}{\sqrt{1 - M_\infty ^2}}.
		\end{equation}
		This equation allows us to compute the pressure distribution in compressible flow, beginning from the incompressible one. 
	}
\end{center}


\wrapfig{12}{r}{5}{0.15}{ch6/10}{fig:6.10}
Since the lift and moment coefficient are given by the integration of the pressure coefficient along the wing, we have the same result for them (so also the slope of lift curve $m$). Here is plotted the experimental data and the approximated m by means of the above relation for $\alpha = 0$ and for different airfoil thickness $\tau$. We can see that for the thinner wings, we have a good agreement, until we reach the \textbf{critical Mach number} (Mach number at infinity for which Mach number 1 is reached on the profile).  This value exceeded, we have shock waves (formula valid only for Mach until 0.8). 
For thicker wings, we see that the slope m is always underestimated. The critical Mach number is here much lower. 

\ \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] If we choose $m=1, \hat{u} = \bar{u}$ so that $C_p = C_{p, inc}$. We see that the pressure coefficient is now the same but the profiles are different following we are in the compressible or incompressible case $\theta = \beta \chi$. 
\end{itemize}

\wrapfig{5}{l}{6.5}{0.1}{ch6/11}{fig:6.11}
The angle relation must be true along the entire profile, particularly at the maximum thickness: 

\begin{equation}
\tau = \beta \tau _{inc}. 
\end{equation}		

\paragraph{Remark 1}
If we take into account the aspect ratio, we can rewrite the slope m as: 

\begin{equation}
m = \frac{m_{inc}}{\beta} \frac{2\pi}{\beta \left(1+\frac{2}{eAR}\right)}
\end{equation}		

where we used the theoretical 2D slope $2\pi$. Another possibility is to write the lift as:

\begin{equation}
c_l = \frac{2\pi}{\beta} (\alpha - \alpha _{L_0} - \alpha _i) = \frac{2\pi}{\beta+\frac{2}{eAR}} (\alpha - \alpha _{L_0})
\end{equation}

We can	last note the existence of the DATCOM formula that accounts for the effect of the aspect ratio, sweep angle $\Lambda$, Mach number and has also a correction factor for viscous effects $\kappa \approx 0.97$: 

\begin{equation}
m = \frac{2\pi AR}{2+\sqrt{\frac{AR^2 + beta ^2}{\kappa ^2}\left( 1+\frac{\tan ^2\Lambda}{\beta ^2} \right)+4}}.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Remark 2}
We can also rearrange the expression of $C_p$ with the approximation of small angles, we had: 

\begin{equation}
C_p = \frac{p-p_\infty}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _\infty V_\infty^2} = \frac{\gamma 2p_\infty}{\gamma \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2}\left(\frac{p}{p_\infty}-1 \right) =  \frac{2}{\gamma M^2_\infty} \left(\frac{p}{p_\infty} -1 \right) \qquad \gamma \frac{p_\infty}{\rho _\infty} = \gamma rT = a^2
\label{eq:6.23}
\end{equation}

The isentropic flow and the constant $T_c$ give: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{p}{p_\infty}  =\left( \frac{T}{T_\infty} \right) ^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}} = \left( \frac{T_t - \frac{1}{2c_p}\left[ (V_\infty +\hat{u})^2 +\hat{v}^2 \right]}{T_\infty} \right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}} \qquad T_t = T_\infty + \frac{V_\infty^2}{2c_p}\\
\Rightarrow &\frac{p}{p_\infty}  =\left[ 1- \frac{\gamma -1}{2}M^2_\infty \left( \frac{2\hat{u}}{V_\infty} +\frac{\hat{u}^2 +\hat{v}^2}{V^2_\infty} \right) \right]^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}} = 1- \frac{\gamma}{2}M^2_\infty \left( \frac{2\hat{u}}{V_\infty} +\frac{\hat{u}^2 +\hat{v}^2}{V^2_\infty} \right)+\dots
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where the last expression comes from the fact that the second term is small so that we have the Taylor development of $1+\epsilon$ (first order limited). We can neglect the second term in bracket since we have small perturbation square, and we get by \eqref{eq:6.23}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{p}{p_\infty} = -\frac{2\hat{u}}{V_\infty}
\end{equation}



\subsection{Discuss the type of this equation as a function of free stream Mach number,	what are the consequences}
\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Transonic smal perturbation potential equation}
		\begin{equation}
		\left[ (1-M_\infty ^2) - (\gamma +1) M^2_\infty \frac{\hat{\phi}_x}{V_\infty}  \right] \hat{\phi} _{xx} + \hat{\phi} _{yy} = 0.
		\end{equation}
	}
\end{center}

We can see that the $\hat{u}$ appears in $\hat{\phi} _{xx}$ term, this is no longer negligible for \textbf{sonic} velocities. For sub- and super-sonic flows however the equation simplifies in: 

\begin{equation}
(1-M_\infty ^2) \hat{\phi} _{xx} + \hat{\phi} _{yy} = 0.
\end{equation}

Note that we retrieve our incompressible equation for $M_\infty \rightarrow 0$. Be aware that this last relation is only valid for small perturbations (small bodies in practice) and sub- or super-sonic flows ($M_\infty > 1.2, M_\infty < 0.8$). 


\subsection{Discuss the application to an airfoil in supersonic flow: lift coefficient, influence of the Mach number, Ackeret formula, lift and drag formula}
\label{Ackeret}

The potential equation we used in the framework of potential equation can be rewritten in the case of supersonic flow as:

\begin{equation}
(1-M_\infty^2) \hat{\phi}_{xx} + \hat{\phi}_{yy} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \lambda ^2 \hat{\phi} _{xx} - \hat{\phi} _{yy} = 0.
\end{equation}

The linearized potential equation corresponds to the wave equation with $\lambda ^2 = M_\infty ^2 -1 >0$. We can show that the solution of this equation is 

\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi}(x,y)= f(x-\lambda y) = \hat{\phi} _{1}(x-\lambda y) + \hat{\phi} _{2} (x+\lambda y).
\end{equation}		

Let's define 2 families of characteristic curves:

\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&C^+ : x-\lambda y = cst \qquad \Rightarrow y = \frac{1}{\lambda} x + cst = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}} c + cst\\
&C^+ : x+\lambda y = cst \qquad \Rightarrow y = -\frac{1}{\lambda} x + cst = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}} c + cst
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{8}{r}{5}{0.15}{ch6/8}{fig:6.8}
In this way, $\hat{\phi} _1$ and $\hat{\phi} _2$ are respectively constant on $C^+$ and $C^-$. The slope is denoted $\mu _\infty ^\pm$ for $C^\pm$ such that: 

\begin{equation}
\tan \mu _\infty ^\pm = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}} \qquad \sin \mu _\infty ^\pm = \pm \frac{1}{M_\infty}.
\end{equation}

To find the general solution in P, let's first consider the initial data given on the y-axis: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi} _1(y) = F(y)\qquad \hat{\phi}_2 (y) = G(y)
\end{equation}

Now let's construct $C^+$ and $C^-$ : 

\begin{equation}
C^+ : x-\lambda y = x_A - \lambda y_A\qquad C^- : x-\lambda y = x_B + \lambda y_B.
\end{equation}

Finally, the solution in P is so given by:

\begin{equation}
\hat{ \phi} (x_p,y_p) = \hat{\phi} (x_A - \lambda y_A) + \hat{\phi} _2 (x_B + \lambda y_B) = F (x_A - \lambda y_A) + G (x_B + \lambda y_B)
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{8}{l}{5}{0.1}{ch6/17}{fig:6.17}
Now let's define the initial conditions at $x=0$ for small $\alpha$ for a thin profile:

\begin{equation}
F(y) = K_1 = cst \qquad G(y) = K_2 = cst \qquad \Rightarrow \hat{\phi} = cst
\end{equation}

since the incoming flow is uniform. On the pressure side, we have $\hat{\phi} _1(x-\lambda y) = K_1$ which gives in the solution: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi}(q) = K_1 + \hat{\phi}_2 (q) \qquad \rightarrow \hat{\phi}_x = \frac{d\hat{\phi}_2}{dq} = \hat{u} ^- \quad \hat{\phi}_y = \frac{d\hat{\phi}_2}{dq}\lambda = \hat{v} ^- \qquad \Rightarrow \hat{v}_{wall} = \lambda \hat{u}_{wall}
\end{equation}

If we express the tangent as $\tan \theta_w \approx \theta_w = \frac{\hat{v}^-_w}{\hat{u}^-+V_\infty} \approx \frac{\hat{v}^-_w}{V_\infty}$,
We can get by replacing the last results in the previous pressure coefficient equation for small perturbations:


\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Law of Ackeret}
		\begin{equation}
		C_p ^- = -\frac{2\hat{u}^-_w}{V_\infty} = -\frac{2\theta_w^-}{\sqrt{M^2_\infty - 1}}.
		\end{equation}
	}
\end{center}

The same reasoning can be done for the suction side where we'll get:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi} _x = \frac{d\hat{\phi}_1}{dq} = \hat{u}^+_w \qquad \hat{\phi} _x = \frac{d\hat{\phi}_1}{dq}(-\lambda) = \hat{v}^+_w = -\lambda \hat{u}^+_w\qquad \Rightarrow C_p^+ = \frac{2\theta_w^+}{\sqrt{M^2_\infty - 1}}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Application to a flat plate}
\wrapfig{8}{l}{7.5}{0.1}{ch6/18}{fig:6.18}
Consider the thin profile define by functions $y^+(x)$ and $y^-(x)$ with angles defines as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\epsilon = \frac{dy}{dx} <0 \qquad \theta = \frac{\hat{v}}{\hat{u} +V_\infty} <0 \\
\Rightarrow &\theta = \epsilon - \alpha = \frac{dy}{dx} - \alpha
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

as $\alpha > 0$. We can then apply the last formula: 

\begin{equation}
C_p^+ = \frac{2\theta_w^+}{\sqrt{M^2_\infty - 1}} = \frac{2\left( \frac{dy^+}{dx} -\alpha \right)}{\sqrt{M^2_\infty - 1}} \qquad C_p^- = -\frac{2\theta_w^-}{\sqrt{M^2_\infty - 1}} = \frac{2\left( \alpha -\frac{dy^-}{dx}\right)}{\sqrt{M^2_\infty - 1}}.
\end{equation}

We are now interested in computing the normal and tangential force applied on the wing, for a counter-clock contour: 

\begin{equation}
C_N = \int _0 ^1 C_p ^- \, \frac{dx}{c} + \int _1 ^0 C_p ^+ \, \frac{dx}{c} = \frac{4\alpha }{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2-1}}
\end{equation}

where we replace the $C_p$'s by their definition and we neglect $\frac{dy}{dx}$ terms. For the drag we have the same procedure but by neglecting this time $\alpha$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&C_\Gamma = -\int _0 ^1 C_p ^- \, \frac{dy}{c} - \int _1 ^0 C_p ^+ \, \frac{dy}{c} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2-1}} \left[ \int _0^1 \left(\frac{dy^-}{dx} \right)^2 \frac{dx}{c} + \int _0^1 \left(\frac{dy^+}{dx} \right)^2 \frac{dx}{c} \right]\\
\Rightarrow &C_\Gamma =  \frac{2}{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2-1}} [I^- + I^+]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

To compute the lift and drag coefficient we only have to make the projections, and in case of flat plate $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 = I^\pm$: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&C_l = -C_\Gamma \sin \alpha + C_N \cos \alpha \approx -\alpha C_\Gamma  + C_N \qquad C_d = C_\Gamma  + \alpha C_N\\
\Rightarrow &C_l = \frac{4\alpha}{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}} \qquad C_d = \frac{4\alpha}{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The drag is the \textbf{wave drag}.

\subsection{What is wave drag ? discuss supersonic flow over double wedge profile}
A wave drag is a drag due to a shock wave. When a shock wave appears, it uses energy, which has to be provided by the aircraft, it is thus seen as a drag.

\wrapfig{8}{r}{6.5}{0.1}{ch6/19}{fig:6.19}
If we apply the Ackeret law to this profile we have:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&C_{p1} = \frac{2(\delta - \alpha)}{\sqrt{M_\infty^2 -1}} \qquad C_{p2} = \frac{2(\delta + \alpha)}{\sqrt{M_\infty^2 -1}} \\
&C_{p3} = \frac{-2(\delta + \alpha)}{\sqrt{M_\infty^2 -1}} \qquad C_{p4} = \frac{-2(\delta - \alpha)}{\sqrt{M_\infty^2 -1}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We can compute the lift and drag coefficients by integrating over the surface:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\vec{F} = -\oint p\, d\vec{S} = -\oint (p-p_\infty)\, d\vec{S} = -\frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 \oint C_p\, d\vec{S}\\
\Rightarrow &\vec{F}_1 = -\frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 C_{p1} \frac{c}{2} \vec{n}_1
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

If we make the force non dimensional: 
\begin{equation}
\vec{C}_1 = \frac{\vec{F}_1}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 c} = -\frac{C_{p1}}{2} \vec{n}_1 \qquad \Rightarrow \vec{C}_i = -\frac{C_{pi}}{2} \vec{n}_i
\end{equation}

If we look to the normal and tangent forces we find: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
C_y = \vec{C}_i .\vec{1}_y = \left(-\frac{C_{p1}}{2} + \frac{C_{p2}}{2} -\frac{C_{p3}}{2} +\frac{C_{p4}}{2} \right) \cos \delta= \frac{4\alpha }{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}} \cos \delta \approx \frac{4\alpha }{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}}\\
C_x = \vec{C}_i .\vec{1}_x = \left(\frac{C_{p1}}{2} + \frac{C_{p2}}{2} -\frac{C_{p3}}{2} -\frac{C_{p4}}{2} \right) \sin \delta = \frac{4\delta }{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}} \sin \delta \approx \frac{4\delta ^2}{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Then we make the same projection as previously: 

\begin{equation}
c_l \approx C_y - \alpha C_x = \frac{4\alpha }{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}} - \frac{4\delta ^2\alpha }{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}}  \approx \frac{4\alpha }{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}} 
\end{equation}

We find thus the same lift coefficient as the flat plate. Let's see the drag: 

\begin{equation}
c_d = C_x + \alpha C_y = \frac{4\alpha }{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}} + \frac{4\delta}{\sqrt{M_\infty ^2 -1}},
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{11}{l}{3}{0.3}{ch6/20}{fig:6.20}
where the first term is \textbf{incidence wave drag} (result of lift), the same as the flat plate and the second term the \textbf{thickness wave drag} (result of volume) corresponding to the drag of the wedge at 0 degrees and angle of attack. The following empirical formula can be used for both drag on wing and on \textbf{complete plane}: 

\begin{equation}
C_{Dw} = k_0 \frac{128}{\pi} \frac{V^2}{Sl^4} + k_1 \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{S}{l^2}\lambda ^2 C_L^2
\end{equation}

where $k_0$ and $k_1$ are constant of order 1 depending on the geometry and l the average length as represented on the figure. 

\subsection{Transonic flow over a profile: what is critical free stream Mach number(+ discussion), what is drag divergence Mach number}
\subsubsection{Critical Mach number}
The critical Mach Number is the $M_\infty$ when $M = 1$ somewhere on the airfoil. Consider a point A, the drag is given by: 

\begin{equation}
C_{p,A} = \frac{2}{\gamma M_\infty^2} \left( \frac{p_A}{p_\infty} -1 \right)
\end{equation}

If we combine the fact that the flow is isentropic:

\begin{equation}
\frac{p_A}{p_\infty} = \left(\frac{T_A}{T_\infty}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1}} = \left(\frac{1+\frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2_\infty}{1+\frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2_A}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1}} 
\quad \Rightarrow C_{p,A} = \frac{2}{\gamma M_\infty^2} \left[ \left(\frac{1+\frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2_\infty}{1+\frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2_A}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1}} -1 \right]
\end{equation}

If now we consider $M_\infty = M_{kr} \rightarrow M_A = 1$, so that the equation becomes: 

\begin{equation}
C_{p,A} = \frac{2}{\gamma M_\infty^2} \left[ \left(\frac{1+\frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2_\infty}{1+\frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2_A}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1}} -1 \right] \qquad C_{p,A} = \frac{C_{p,A,inc}}{\sqrt{1-M_{kr}^2}},
\end{equation}


\wrapfig{10}{r}{5}{0.15}{ch6/13}{fig:6.13}
where the second equation is the Prandtl-Glauert relation. 
We can plot the two equations on a graph. The intersection of the two graphs gives the critical Mach number. We can see that the minimum lift coefficient at low velocities is more negative than the thin case, characterized by a smaller $M_{kr}$. The perturbation of the flow is higher. Flying at high subsonic velocities is important $\rightarrow$ thin airfoil. When the angle of attack increases, the lift increases but the higher velocity on the suction part makes the $M_{kr}$ much lower. We want so the wing to be as thin as possible but we are limited by the structural strength and the fuel storage.

\ \\
\wrapfig{10}{l}{4.5}{0.1}{ch6/14}{fig:6.14}
We avoid also large bending of the leading edge to avoid large accelerations. One solution to increase $M_{kr}$ is to place the maximum camber downstream, about 50\% of the chord because the velocities on the suction side will be lower. Placing it too downstream will create a too high opposite gradient and cause separation. 

\ \\ Symmetrical wings have a larger $M_{kr}$, however be careful with combination of sharp LE because of LE separation. In practice we have a quasi-symmetrical profile with camber near LE. \textbf{Swept} wings also increase the $M_{kr}$. 

\minifig{ch6/15}{ch6/16}{0.2}{0.15}{0.45}{0.3}

We wan observe here above, the plot of $\alpha, C_L$ and $C_D$ for a symmetrical and a non-symmetrical airfoil. We can observe on \autoref{ch6/15} that the slope of the lift curve goes up to $M=0.83$ (Prandtl-Glauert). Once above $M_{kr}$ it starts to decrease and the drag suddenly increases. \\

On \autoref{ch6/16} we can see similar effects at the difference that around $M_{kr}$ we have a positive increase of the zero lift angle, having a negative effect on longitudinal stability. Note that the decrease of the lift curve starts earlier, $M_{kr}$ is smaller. 

\subsubsection{Drag divergence Mach number}
\wrapfig{22}{l}{4.5}{0.2}{ch6/1}{fig:6.1}
At the critical Mach number $M_\infty = M_{cr}$, the flow reaches $M=1$ somewhere on the wing. If the velocity at $\infty$ is increased, $M_\infty$ also (still <0), a small area where the flow becomes \textbf{supersonic} will develop on the \textbf{suction side}. For increasing $M_\infty$ this area will growth and at a certain $M_\infty$ a \textbf{shock wave} will develop, as a result of which the flow will become \textbf{subsonic} again (the supersonic area abruptly terminated). Such area also develops on the \textbf{pressure side} at high $M_\infty$ (\autoref{fig:6.1} (a)).

\ \\ If $M_\infty$ increases further, the supersonic regions further extends and the shock waves moves downstream, the one on the pressure side more rapidly (\autoref{fig:6.1} (b) (c)). As soon as the shock waves are strong enough, they can cause separation of the boundary layer, this separation is the \textbf{shock stall} and the $M_\infty$ where this happen is called the \textbf{drag divergence Mach number}. Indeed, the drag suddenly increases as result of the separation, this called \textbf{transonic drag rise}, shown on \autoref{fig:6.2}. 

\ \\ For further increase of $M_\infty <1$, the shock wave on the pressure side eventually reaches the trailing edge (\autoref{fig:6.1} (d)). In a certain Mach number range, the shock wave manifests the so-called $\bm{\lambda}$ \textbf{shocks}. Near the profile the shock has two legs, a first oblique one through which the flow is slowed down but remains supersonic, and a second normal one through which the flow becomes subsonic. 

\ \\ Eventually the shock wave on the suction side can also reach the trailing edge and give birth to the \textbf{bifurcated trailing edge shock} patern (\autoref{fig:6.1} (e)). 

\ \\ For further increase of $M_\infty$ there is no change, till $M_\infty$ exceeds 1. In this case, a so-called \textbf{detached bow shock} develops upstream of the leading edge. There is a small subsonic region between this shock and the leading edge. This manifests both for thick, bounded leading edge and thin one (\autoref{fig:6.1} (f) (g)). In the second case, the bow shock changes into 2 oblique shocks at the leading edge for increasing $M_\infty$ (\autoref{fig:6.1} (h)). This happens at the \textbf{shock attachment Mach number}, $\bm{M_{SA}}$. For further $M_{\infty}$, the flow becomes fully supersonic and the drag decreases. In the case of rounded leading edge, the bow shock continues to exist and comes closer to the leading edge. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch6/2}

	\end{minipage}

		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch6/3}
		\captionof{figure}{}
		\label{fig:6.3}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Under transonic conditions the flow is non-stationary, the shock waves moves up and down on the wing. The pilot senses this as \textbf{buffeting} (response of the structure to aerodynamic excitation) and vibrations. This can make the plane uncontrollable or cause serious damages. The cause of the excitation is the fluctuating pressure in non-stationary conditions. Normally one flies under the buffeting margin but one can exceed it in case of sudden maneuvers for fighters for example. \\

The center of pressure is also moving with $M_\infty$ (\autoref{fig:6.3}). First, it goes backward as the shock wave going backward on the suction side makes the underpressure greater. Then, it goes forward because the shock wave on the pressure side is moving faster. The latter reaches the trailing edge while the shock wave on the suction side still moves backward, making the center of pressure again move backward, tending to the 50\% chord. This makes the control of the plane more difficult. \\

\wrapfig{7}{l}{5.5}{0.15}{ch6/4}{fig:6.4}
It is this buffeting effect that imposes an upper limit to the velocity of subsonic planes. With the increase of the drag due to separation when shock waves (shock-stall) is associated a decrease of the lift. We can see that the lift temporary increases after the lower shock reaches the trailing edge. This is explained by the smaller separation when in this location. The drag divergence Mach number is 5-10\% larger than $M_{cr}$. 

\ \\

\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch6/5}
		\captionof{figure}{}

		\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{ch6/6}
		\captionof{figure}{}
		\label{fig:6.6}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}

On \autoref{fig:6.5} we can see the influence of increasing lift (increasing $\alpha$). We can notice that with increasing lift, the drag increases for all Mach numbers, the moment increases in the transonic region and $M_{cr}$ decreases. On \autoref{fig:6.6}, we notice that the lift coefficient strongly decreases in the transonic region due to buffering effects. 


\subsection{Compute the lift coefficient for a 2D profile in compressible flow, assuming that the lift coefficient for the same airfoil is known for incompressible flow.}
Using Prandtl-Glauert : $C_p = \frac{C_{p,inc}}{\beta} = \frac{C_{p,inc}}{\sqrt{1 - M_\infty ^2}}$. Since lift is an integration of pressure: $C_L = \frac{C_{L,inc}}{\beta} = \frac{C_{L,inc}}{\sqrt{1 - M_\infty ^2}}$

\section{Transonic flow over an airfoil - critical Mach number and drag divergence Mach	number}
\subsection{Give definition of critical free stream Mach number}
See above

\subsection{Explain the effect of the thickness of the profile on the critical Mach number}
Thinner airfoil gives higher critical Mach number. This can be explained as following: the $M_{kr}$ is the Mach where $M=1$ is obtained somewhere on the profile. The flow is accelerated over the profile, if the thickness is bigger, flow accelerates more, which leads to early $M=1$ compared to a thinner airfoil.

\subsection{All questions related to divergence Mach number, shock patterns from sub- to supersonic, $C_D$ versus Mach, buffeting}
See above

\subsection{Explain supercritical wing profiles}

\wrapfig{16}{l}{9.5}{0.15}{ch6/7}{fig:6.7}
For subsonic wings, it is thus desired to have the largest drag divergence Mach number possible. This can be achieved by using high critical Mach number wings, or increase the difference  $M_{div} -M_{cr}$. The second solution led to the supercritical wings. These have a rather flat suction side to limit the acceleration of the flow, keeping the supersonic speeds lower than other profiles and limit the strength of the shock that creates less drag. The comparison between the two type of wings is done on \autoref{fig:6.7}. We can see that the $M_{cr}$ is higher and the weaker shock wave closer to the trailing edge. 

\ \\ The new shape of the suction side has a negative effect on the lift, this is compensate by an increased curvature on the pressure side near the trailing edge. On the figure we can see that the use of critical wings increases the drag divergence Mach number, that can go up to 0.99. These allows the use of thicker wings, allowing more fuel storage at lower speeds.

\section{3D wing in compressible flow in subsonic and supersonic flow}
\subsection{Discuss the 3D linearized potential equation for subsonic flow, compare the	compressible and incompressible case}
The previous potential equation can be extended into 3D into the same conditions like: 

\begin{equation}
\beta ^2 \hat{\phi} _{xx} + \hat{\phi} _{yy} + \hat{\phi} _{zz} = 0.
\end{equation}

Then we apply the transformation of $(x, y, z)$ to $(X, y, z)$ with $X = \frac{x}{\beta}$ so that the previous equation becomes: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi} _{XX} + \hat{\phi} _{yy} + \hat{\phi} _{zz} = 0.
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{7}{l}{6}{0.07}{ch7/1}{ch7/1}
The flow in $(x,y,z)$ is compressible with $M<1$, when in $(X,y,z)$ it is incompressible. The solution or $\phi$ in similar points (points $x,y,z$ and $x/\beta,y,z$) is the same. This kind of transformation is represented on the figure. We remark that the leading edges sweep and the aspect ratios are related as: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\tan \sigma _0}{\sigma} = \frac{n}{m} = \frac{1}{\beta} \qquad \frac{AR_0}{AR} = \frac{b^S_0}{b^2S} = \frac{c}{c_0} = \beta. 
\end{equation}

The slope of the wing in the z-direction is the same in the two axis: 
\begin{equation}
\tan \theta \approx \theta = \frac{\hat{w}}{\hat{u}+V_\infty} \approx \frac{\hat{w}}{V_\infty}. 
\end{equation}



\subsection{Derive Prandtl Glauert rule for a subsonic wing in compressible flow}
Using the same ideas as the 2D wing, the pressure coefficient for small perturbations is known: 

\begin{equation}
C_p = -\frac{2\hat{\phi}_{x}}{V_\infty} = -\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{2\hat{\phi}_{X}}{V_\infty} = \frac{C_{p0}}{\beta}.
\end{equation}

We obtain the same equation as in 2D, whereas now the profiles are not identical! For the lift on a section (y = cst), we can compute the integral:

\begin{equation}
L' = \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2\int _{LE} ^{TE} (c_{pl} - c_{pu})\, dx
= \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2\int _{LE} ^{TE} \frac{c_{pl,inc} - c_{pu,inc}}{\beta} \beta\, dX = L_0'
\end{equation}

They are the same, whereas the lift coefficients respect $c_l' = \frac{c_{l0}'}{\beta}$. This is also valid for the lift curve slope.

\subsection{Discuss the 3D linearized potential equation for supersonic flow, compare the compressible flow with the supersonic flow at freestream Mach number $sqrt(2)$}
In this case the potential equation becomes:

\begin{equation}
\lambda ^2 \hat{\phi} _{xx} + \hat{\phi} _{yy} + \hat{\phi} _{zz} = 0.
\end{equation}

If we apply the analogous transformation we have:

\begin{equation}
X = \frac{x}{\lambda} \qquad \Rightarrow  \hat{\phi} _{XX} + \hat{\phi} _{yy} + \hat{\phi} _{zz} = 0.
\end{equation}

This equation does not correspond anymore to the equation of an incompressible flow since $\lambda = \sqrt{M_\infty ^2 - 1}$ and to have $\lambda = 1$ we need $M_\infty = \sqrt{2}$, thus the new flow is a $M_\infty = \sqrt{2}$. The previously found relations with $\beta$ are valid for $\lambda$.

\section{3D wing in compressible transonic flow. Discuss effect of sweep on performance of a 3D wing in compressible flow -- Influence on Lift and drag}

\minifig{ch7/2}{ch7/3}{0.15}{0.15}{0.3}{0.3}
This is a technique used in order to increase the critical mach number. Indeed, the flow seen by the 2D wing is the one perpendicular to the wing:

\begin{equation}
V_{\infty n} = V_{\infty}\cos \sigma \qquad \Rightarrow M_{kr}^\sigma= \frac{M_{kr}^{\sigma = 0}}{\cos^m \sigma}
\end{equation}

where we can see that the $M_\infty$ will be higher and where m varying parameter in function of the $C_L$, it decreases with lift (\autoref{ch7/3}). If the sweep angle is large enough, the flow seen by the LE can become subsonic and allow rounded shapes which is advantageous for subsonic speeds. The drag divergence mach number also increases:

\begin{equation}
M_{div} = M_{kr} [1.02 + 0.08 (1-\cos \sigma)].
\end{equation}

\subsection{Lift of swept wings}
Remind the definition of $C_p$: 

\begin{equation}
C_{pn} = \frac{p-p_\infty}{\frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_{\infty n} ^2} \qquad L_n = \frac{1}{2}\rho _\infty V_{\infty n} ^2 \int _{LE} ^{TE} (C_{pln} - C_{pun}) \, dx 
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{11}{l}{4.5}{0.12}{ch7/4}{ch7/4}
where we see that if $M_{\infty n} = M_\infty^*$ ($M_\infty^*$ in this case is the one we have without sweep), the pressure distribution and thus the lift remains constant. This means that for a same approaching speed $V_\infty^*$ without and with sweep we will decrease the lift (we have to fly at higher speed). The lift coefficient also decreases for $V_{\infty n} = V_\infty^*$:

\begin{equation}
c_{l}^* = \frac{L^*}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _\infty V_{\infty}^*} > c_{l} = \frac{L^*}{\frac{1}{2}\rho _\infty V_{\infty}}
\end{equation}

where $^*$ designate the same value in non swept wing. We see that the lift coefficient decreases. 

\wrapfig{5}{l}{6}{0.15}{ch7/5}{ch7/5}
Pay attention that this is the case when we are in subsonic flight. Indeed, the sweep increases the lift for supersonic as the shock stall is postponed ($M_{\infty n}$ seen smaller). In practice, to have significant influence of sweep $\sigma$ must be high (at least 30\degres - 40\degres). 

\subsection{Lift coefficient as a function of the angle of attack for swept wings}	
\wrapfig{8}{r}{6}{0.15}{ch7/6}{ch7/6}
As we have seen, the lift and the lift coefficient decreases when sweep wings. This implies that the slope of the lift curve is also smaller. Remark that we have the same AR in the figure, in practive the AR of swept wing is smaller than the one without (2 to 4 - sweep, 6 to 10 - subsonic), but the lift slope is even smaller. 

\ \\ There are structural advantages as it allows to have thinner airfoils (better for high speed), and the $M_{kr}$ increases. To increase the structural strength we use \textbf{taper} (chord decreases from root to tip). This smaller AR induces more drag, demanding more take-off and landing distance. The reduced slope of lift requires high $\alpha$ when landing and take-off (Concorde drooped nose), but there is no pronounced stall limit.    

\subsection{Influence of the sweep angle on the drag}	
\wrapfig{7}{l}{6}{0.1}{ch7/7}{ch7/7}
One observes the increase of $M_{div}$, the decrease of the maximum drag coefficient (must have large angles to have significant effects). At sufficiently high Mach numbers, $M_n$ will reach the supersonic limit and produce the same effect as seen previously. In that case, the drag with no swept wing is smaller at this stage. 

\subsection{Separation behavior}
\wrapfig{9}{r}{6}{0.1}{ch7/8}{ch7/8}
First, remind that the pressure on the suction side decreases moving from the root to the tip, perpendicularly to the flow, inducing a flow. In practice, we try to have the separation at TE the nearest to the root not to disturb the ailerons (or else loose of control). The problem is that as we are already beyond the peak of underpressure at the root, to the tip we reach the underpressure, thus the boundary layer is pushed to the tip, resulting in a flow of low velocity and low energy. This will separate easily. 

\minifig{ch7/9}{ch7/10}{0.12}{0.1}{0.35}{0.3}

Solutions to limit this are: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] \textbf{washout}: we make the geometry in order to reduce $\alpha$ when going to the tip and increase the speed.
	
	\item[•] \textbf{separation at root}: we force it to happen there for example by sharp LE
	
	\item[•] \textbf{use of slots and slats} (see further)
	
	\item[•] \textbf{stall fences}: it is a device placed on the wing in order to brake the flow going from root to tip (\autoref{ch7/9}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Area rule}
\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Theorem of Hayes}\\
		
		\textit{Within the limits of small perturbations, different planes with the same evolution of the area of their cross section will have the same wave drag at transonic Mach numbers (at zero lift).}
	}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Whitcomb}\\
		
		\textit{In order to limit the wave drag for transonic flows, the variation of the area of the cross-section of a plane should be as smooth as possible, without abrupt changes.}
	}
\end{center}

\minifig{ch7/18}{ch7/19}{0.12}{0.12}{0.35}{0.3}


This means that the cross section of the fuselage must be reduced near the tail in order to have that smooth variation. On this figure see the decrease and the late of the peak in drag around M=1 with area rule.

\subsection{Forward Swept wings}
\wrapfig{6}{l}{3}{0.1}{ch7/14}{ch7/14}
The \textbf{Forward Swept Wing (FSW)} has the same effect of the aft swept wing (ASW), but has advantages because the separation principle we have seen is reversed such that the separation occurs on the root $\rightarrow$ higher lift. At maximum lift, the FSW has an elliptic lift distribution along the wing, leading to less induced drag than the ASW which has a peak at the tip. This leads to a better efficiency of ailerons and flaps. 

\ \\

\wrapfig{6}{r}{5}{0.1}{ch7/15}{ch7/15} 
But there is a structural instability. Indeed, the load is always accompanied with a bending of the wing. In straight case, there is no rotation of the profile. For the ASW the profile will move downward implying a decrease of the angle of attack (lift) and compensating the bending. In FSW the profile move upward, increasing $\alpha$ and the lift, causing more bending and so on $\rightarrow$ unstable. This can be avoided by sufficient structural strength.

\section{Delta wings}
\subsection{Discuss the mechanism for lift creation over a delta wing}
\wrapfig{9}{l}{5}{0.15}{ch7/21}{ch7/21}
The idea of delta wings is to control the separation. By using a sharp LE one obtains a fixed separation line on LE. This is a considerably swept wing but has less problems with tip stall. This is due to the vorticies at the LE on the upper side that avoid the boundary layer to reach the tips. The separation area being limited, that produces an underpressure on the upper side and contributes to lift. 

\ \\
The slope of the lift curve is small, we can reach high $\alpha \approx 35\degres$. At still higher $\alpha$ the vorticies will lose their structure (\textbf{vortex burst}) and the underpressure will disappear, lift goes down. The large wings produce large lift and flaps are not needed. Tail plane are not necessary and the large chord at the root allows thick wings, keeping $t/c$ low, increasing structural strength, allowing fuel storage and engines integration (reduction of drag). To have good subsonic conditions, $b/l \approx 0.25$ or not smaller than 2.

\paragraph{Remark 1}
This description only applies for subsonic LE. If it is supersonic there is no separation at the LE, there is a shock wave on the wing causing boundary layer separation.  

\paragraph{Remark 2}
The lift creating process is different here. Joukowski theorem tells that it is based on vortex sheet, which is quasi horizontal for traditional wings. For delta wings the vortex sheet is rolled up. For wings with very low AR, $c_l$ in function of $\alpha$ is given by the \textbf{formula of Jones}:

\begin{equation}
c_l = \pi \alpha \frac{db}{dx}
\end{equation}	 

under the assumption that the wing lies perfectly in the Mach cone and where $\frac{db}{dx}=cst$ for delta wings. 

\paragraph{Remark 3}
The vorticies cause the transition to turbulent flow. If one wants laminar flow boundary layer control is needed. 

\subsection{Discuss the formula of Jones giving the lift coefficient as a function of the angle of attack}
\begin{equation}
c_l = \pi \alpha \frac{db}{dx}
\end{equation}	 

assuming that the wing lies perfectly in the Mach cone and where $\frac{db}{dx}$ is the variation of the semi span in the direction of the flow, which is constant for a delta wing $\Rightarrow$ the lift coefficient has a constant slope with respect to $\alpha$.

\subsection{What are the advantages and disadvantages of delta wings with respect to:}
\paragraph{Stability:}
Delta wings give high manoeuvrability, which is often seen as competitive to stability for rolling. Delta wings are however stable in pitch (by geometry).

\paragraph{Lift performance:}
Due to high surface, lift is generally very high (no need for flaps or other high lift devices).

\paragraph{Stall and high angle of attack flight:}
As discussed above, the stall will operate at much higher angle of attack (up to $\alpha \approx 35\degres$), and high angle of attack gives high lift.

\section{High lift devices}
\subsection{Why and when are high lift devices needed}
he main objective of lift is to counterbalance the weight: 

\begin{equation}
W = L = C_L \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 S.
\end{equation}

In particular at take-off and landing, one wants to haver the higher possible lift at the lowest possible speed. 2 solutions: increase $S$ or $C_L$. The two solutions increase the drag.

\subsection{How can the lift be increased: 2 basic principles}

\begin{equation}
W = L = C_L \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 S.
\end{equation}

Suppose now that $V_\infty \ll$, there are 2 options to increase lift: increasing $C_L$ or increasing $S$. The problem is that the 2 solutions increase the drag, the first need an increased camber, and for the second $D = C_D \frac{1}{2} \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 S$. The best solution is to increase $C_L$ only for $V_\infty \ll$ and this can be done by changing the geometry or by controlling the boundary layer (attached flow). 

\subsection{Discuss different kinds of trailing edge flaps}

\subsubsection{Plain flap}
\wrapfig{4}{r}{5}{0.1}{ch5/1}{ch5/1}
The principle of flaps is to increase the camber. This is the most simple, the trailing edge shifts downward, increasing $C_L$. The characteristics are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] Because of separation appearing earlier $\alpha _{stall} \searrow$, this is better for the view of the pilot. 
	\item[•] $C_L(max)$ is up to 50\% higher, reached for high deflection $\approx 80\degres$.
	\item[•] The drag increases much more than the lift $C_L/C_D \searrow$, this is good for landing as it helps to decelerate.
	\item[•] Center of pressure at the trailing edge $\rightarrow \Delta C_m<0$ (nose down). 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Split flap}
\wrapfig{3}{r}{3}{0.15}{ch5/2}{ch5/2} \ \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] Separation appears later than the previous case, $\alpha _{stall} \searrow$ less. 
	\item[•] Larger wake because of the split $\rightarrow$ more drag, not good for take off. 
	\item[•] $C_L(max) \nearrow$ up to 60\% and nose down less than previous case. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Slotted flap}
\wrapfig{5}{l}{4}{0.1}{ch5/3}{ch5/3}
In this case $\alpha _{stall}$ increases compared to plain because of the slot allowing the control of separation and the increase of $C_D$ is smaller than the plain flap. $C_L(max) \approx 65\%$.

\ \\

\subsubsection{Fowler flap}
\wrapfig{6}{r}{4}{0.1}{ch5/4}{ch5/4}
This the most used type of flap, combination of the slotted flap and a backward motion: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] $C_L \nearrow$ further compared to slotted.  
	\item[•] $\alpha _{stall} \searrow$ compared to slotted because of $\frac{t}
	{c}\searrow$.
	\item[•] $\Delta C_D \searrow$ because boundary layer control + $\frac{t}{c} \searrow$.
	\item[•] $\Delta C_m \gg$ because flap going backward. In practice, the fowler flap contains many slots. 
\end{itemize}

The figures below shows a good summary. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.25\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch5/5}
		\captionof{figure}{}

	\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ch5/7}
		\captionof{figure}{}	
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] $\frac{dC_m}{dC_L}\approx cst$, this implies that k in $C_m = C_{m0} + k C_L$ does not change and that the \textbf{aerodynamic center} doesn't change. 
	
	\item[•] The flaps are placed near the fuselage, this decreases the efficiency, changes the loft distribution on the wing that have effect on $D_i$ and the pressure center closer to the fuselage can have effects on the stability. 
	
	\item[•] Other types of flaps: Zap flap (split + fowler), $C_L$ is higher than the split but the drag is higher than fowler. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discuss the effect of slats}
\minifig{ch5/8}{ch5/9}{0.2}{0.15}{0.3}{0.3}
The slats are separated from the airfoil by a slot. This allows to energies the boundary layer by a flow through the slot. This has no effect for small $/alpha$, it allows to increase $\alpha _{stall}$ going from 15\degres to 25\degres, increasing $C_L(max)$ up to 60\%. The disadvantage is that for low speeds the drag decreases (less detached boundary), this is bad for landing. And for higher speeds the flow disturbance increases the drag. \textbf{Controllable slats} are necessary. \\

The second disadvantage is that to have the lift increase effect we nee to go to very high $\alpha$, not good for the sight of the pilot. 

\subsection{Discuss boundary layer control}	
\paragraph{Boundary layer blowing}
We saw previously that it was possible to energize the boundary layer by injecting high speed air throw slots. This makes increase $\alpha _{stall}$ and the high velocity increases the circulation, thus $L \ \forall \alpha$. 

\paragraph{Boundary layer suction}
This consist in sucking away the low velocity air by means of porous wings or suction holes. 

\paragraph{Remark}
\wrapfig{6}{l}{5}{0.15}{ch5/12}{ch5/12}
For vertical or short take off and landing, the engine jet is used. The air coming from the engine is redirected to energize the boundary layer. VTOL: jet engine is deflected vertically for vertical take off, where the thrust must be equal to the weight, while it is about 30\% for horizontal take off.

\section{Tailplanes}

\subsection{Discuss why tail planes are needed in order to have a stable wing configuration}

\wrapfig{6}{r}{3.5}{0.15}{ch5/13}{ch5/13}
Consider $\alpha$ small so that the lift is assumed perpendicular to the chord, applied on the AC and the weight is applied on the center of gravity. The moment in the center of gravity is:

\begin{equation}
C_m = C_{M_0} + C_L (h-h_0) \qquad \Rightarrow \frac{dC_m}{dC_L} = h -h_0 > 0.
\end{equation}	 

And since $dC_L/d\alpha = m$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dC_m}{d\alpha} = m(h-h_0)>0
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{5}{r}{5}{0.15}{ch5/14}{ch5/14}
and the wing is \textbf{statically unstable} because the increase in $\alpha$ causes an increase in $C_m$ and so even more nose up. We see that in fact the wing alone is stable only if the center of gravity is upstream of the aerodynamic center. 
\textbf{Tail} planes are used to increase stability, one has now: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{dC_m}{d\alpha} = m(h-h_0) - \frac{C_{L_T}}{d\alpha} \gamma 
\end{equation}

where $\gamma = \frac{l S_T}{cS}$ as $C_{L_T} = \frac{L_T}{0.5\rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 S_T}$. One can reach stability for sufficiently high $\gamma$, by increasing $l$ or $S_T$. 

\subsection{Discuss canard as an alternative for tail plane}
One can use canards, which are similar to tail planes but situated near the nose. One can see that this could lead to the same analysis than above for planes with centre of gravity upstream compared to the aerodynamic centre.

\section{Viscous and turbulent effects}
\subsection{Discuss skin friction drag for laminar and turbulent flow}

Drag is caused by first the pressure distribution (form drag) and also by the viscous stresses (skin friction drag). At small $\alpha$ the skin friction represents 80-90\% of the total drag and at stall conditions it is the form drag. \\

The form drag is also consequence of the viscous effects, the boundary layer due to viscous effect influences the pressure distribution. The viscous flow can be interpreted as the inviscid flow around an effective profile corrected with its boundary layer. In general this effective wing changes with $\alpha$, has a smaller camber than the real wing so that the lift curve has a smaller slope than the inviscid with $C_L$ smaller up to 10\%  for $Re = 10^6$. 	

\subsubsection{Laminar flow}
Consider a flat plate at $\alpha = 0$ and incompressible flow, the skin friction is: 

\begin{equation}
C_f = \frac{1}{0.5 \rho _\infty V_\infty ^2 c} \int _0^c \tau _w \,dx = \frac{1.328}{\sqrt{Re_c}} \qquad Re_c = \frac{V_\infty c}{\nu}
\end{equation}

The boundary layer thickness $\delta$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
\delta (x) = \frac{5x}{\sqrt{Re_x}}
\end{equation}

If the flow is compressible, the Mach number will play a role and the Prandtl number will appear as we have to take into account the energy equation for Navier-Stokes:

\begin{equation}
Pr = \frac{\mu C_p}{\kappa}
\end{equation}

In incompressible flow the temperature of the flow remained more or less constant, this is not the case here, the boundary conditions on the plate (temperature) will influence the results. The skin friction and the boundary thickness become: 

\begin{equation}
C_f = \frac{1.328}{\sqrt{Re_c}}F \left( M_\infty , Pr, \frac{T_w}{T_\infty} \right)\qquad \delta = \frac{5x}{\sqrt{Re_x}}G \left( M_\infty , Pr, \frac{T_w}{T_\infty} \right)
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{8}{l}{6}{0.15}{ch4/1}{ch4/1}
The functions F and G are found numerically. Here are plotted for several temperature and Mach numbers the skin friction over an adiabatic flat plate. One notice that the friction decreases with temperature of the wall and with Mach number. 

\ \\ Below is plotted the effect of the temperature on the velocity field and the temperature distribution in the boundary layer. One can see that the increase of $T_w$ decreases $\frac{du}{dy}$ and so the friction $\tau _w = \mu (\frac{du}{dy})$. We also see that $\delta$ increases. On the right figure, we see that the $\delta$ increases with increasing Mach number for constant Re number. Increasing Re number decreases the friction.  

\minifig{ch4/2}{ch4/3}{0.15}{0.2}{0.49}{0.49}

\subsubsection{Turbulent flow}
\wrapfig{9}{l}{8}{0.15}{ch4/4}{ch4/4}
The formula now are:

\begin{equation}
C_f = \frac{0.074}{Re_c^{1/5}} \qquad \delta = \frac{0.37x}{Re_x^{1/5}}
\end{equation}

and one can see on the plot that the turbulent flow has a larger friction for the same Re and $C_f$ decreases with Mach number (the decrease is higher than laminar).

\subsection{Discuss methods to reduce viscous drag: natural laminar flow and riblets}

\subsubsection{Natural laminar flow and control of laminar flow}
As the friction in laminar flow is lower than in turbulent, one tries to keep the flow like that as possible. We have to place an active control in critical areas like the leading edge. When the air accelerates, the pressure decreases and there is a positive pressure gradient pushing from backward and leading to small separation. When the flow reataches, it becomes turbulent. This is avoided by sucking away the air in the boundary layer (slots or porous wing) as a result of what the low energy air disappears. For laminar flows, one tries to use \textbf{adapted wing profiles} and not active control. The wing profile has to be as smooth as possible and the lower pressure point as far downstream from the LE as possible. With this aim, the NACA 6 series has been developped. \\

For example the NACA 65-218 has a point of min pressure at 0.5 chord downstream of the LE, the design lift coefficient 0.2 and thickness of 18\%. 

\wrapfig{6}{l}{5}{0.15}{ch4/5}{ch4/5}
On (a) is represented the pressure distribution over NACA 65-018 for design lift coefficient 0 and $c_l=0.32$. In both cases there is an undesirable pressure gradient at 50\% chord. On (b) one sees that the drag is small for $-0.3 < c_l <0.3$ $\rightarrow$ laminar. 

\ \\[5cm]
\subsubsection{Reduction of the drag in turbulent flows}
\wrapfig{14}{l}{4}{0.15}{ch4/6}{ch4/6}
An advantage of turbulent flow is that it resists better to separation, so it is preferred in reverse gradient areas. To reduce the drag, we introduce \textbf{riblets} in the flow direction.  This is illustrated on (c), the velocity distribution in the boundary layer induces spanwise vorticies in the y direction, which is unstable. Because of its instability, it is deformed and lifted away from the wall. Because of this he breaks down and induces vortices in the flow direction which desintegrate and result in turbulent flow. Riblets have a stabilizing effect, they delay the transition to turbulent and make the flow in the viscous layer less chaotic when turbulent, so reducing drag.  

\ \\ 

The maximum drag reduction for profile 13R is 7-8\% obtained for $s^+ \approx 15$ and 33 reduction of $\approx 2\%$.

\section{Weak solutions – shocks and contact discontinuities.\\ Start form the Euler equations in conservative form:}
\subsection{Determine shock relations starting from the weak formulation}

Flow equations also allow non-continuous solutions $\rightarrow$ \textbf{weak}. We limit the study to stationary weak solutions for which the discontinuity does not change in time. We restrict ourselves to non viscous 2D flows, respecting Euler equations (mass, momentum, energy) which allows discontinuities. Let's remind the Euler hyperbolic equation and the scalar convection equation: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D u}{\D t} + a \frac{\D u}{\D x} = 0 \qquad u = f(x-at) = f(q)
\end{equation}

The derivatives give: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D u}{\D t} = \frac{\D f}{\D q} \frac{\D q}{\D t} = \frac{\D f}{\D q} (-a)\qquad \frac{\D u}{\D x} = \frac{\D f}{\D q} \frac{\D q}{\D x} = \frac{\D f}{\D q} (1)
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{ch8/7}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{center}

Initial wave is shifted on the right. Euler equation in 2D comes from the 1D momentum equation: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D u}{\D t} + u\frac{\D u}{\D x} = \frac{1}{\rho } \mu \frac{\D u^2}{\D  x^2} + \cancel{\frac{1}{\rho }\frac{\D p}{\D x}}
\end{equation}

If the Re number tends to infinity, the right side is cancelled and we switch from N-S equations to Euler equation:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\D u}{\D t} + \frac{\D F}{\D x} + \frac{\D G}{\D y} = 0 \\
u= \left( \begin{array}{c}
\rho \\
\rho u\\
\rho v\\
\rho E
\end{array}
\right)
\qquad 
F= \left( \begin{array}{c}
\rho \\
\rho u^2 + p\\
\rho uv\\
\rho uH
\end{array}
\right)
\qquad 
u= \left( \begin{array}{c}
\rho v\\
\rho uv\\
\rho v^2 +p\\
\rho vH
\end{array}
\right)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

where u is the vector of \textbf{conservative variables}, F and G are the \textbf{flux vectors}, E the total energy and H the total enthalpy. More compact: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D  u}{\D t} + \nabla \bar{\bar{F}} = 0 \qquad \bar{\bar{F}} = (F,G).
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{10}{l}{5}{0.5}{ch8/1}{ch8/1}
When stationary, $\nabla \bar{\bar{F}} = 0$. A shock is a discontinuity and derivatives are not defined. They have to satisfy the integral to be a weak solution: 

\begin{equation}
\int _V \nabla \bar{\bar{F}}\, dV = 0 \Rightarrow \oint _S \bar{\bar{F}}\vec{n} \, dS= 0
\end{equation}

We can split it into the 4 faces of the surface by considering it infinitely thin (so 2 faces vanish): 

\begin{equation}
\int _{S_1} \bar{\bar{F}}\vec{n}_1 \, dS + \int _{S_2} \bar{\bar{F}}\vec{n2} \, dS = 0 = [\bar{\bar{F}}\vec{n}]_1^2
\end{equation}

where the last equality comes from $\vec{n} = \vec{n}_2 = \vec{n}_1$ and the control volume infinitely small. If above condition is satisfied, the discontinuity is a solution of the non-viscous equations: 

\begin{equation}
\bar{\bar{F}}\vec{n} = F n_x + Gn_y = \left( \begin{array}{c}
\rho (\vec{u}\vec{n})\\
\rho u (\vec{u} \vec{n} + pn_x)\\
\rho v (\vec{u} \vec{n} + pn_y)\\
\rho H (\vec{u}\vec{n})	
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}

The first condition to satisfy, coming from mass conservation, is then: 

\begin{equation}
\rho _1 u_{n_1} = \rho _2 u_{n_2}
\end{equation}

The one coming from impulse conservation is: 

\begin{equation}
[\rho \vec{u}(\vec{u}\vec{n})+p\vec{n}]^2_1 \quad \Rightarrow p_1 + \rho _1 u_{n_1}^2 = p_2 + \rho _2 u_{n_2}^2
\end{equation}

where we added a scalar product with $\vec{n}$. If we make now the scalar product with the tangential component $\vec{t}$ we find: 

\begin{equation}
\rho _1 u_{n_1} u_{t_1} = \rho _2 u_{n_2} u_{t_2}\quad \Rightarrow u_{t_1} =u_{t_2}
\end{equation}

where we used the mass conservation. \textbf{The velocity is conserved along the shock in both sides}.The last equation in the same way gives: 

\begin{equation}
H_1 = H_2
\end{equation}

\textbf{conservation of entropy across the shock} like on a streamline. 

\subsection{Discuss contact or slip discontinuities}
If we consider a discontinuous streamline, $\dot{m} = \vec{u}\vec{n} = 0$ and implies by momentum condition: 

\begin{equation}
p_1 \vec{u} = p_2 \vec{u} \qquad \Rightarrow p_1 = p_2
\end{equation}

$un = 0$ is the definition of the \textbf{shear layer}. The density is not conserved with the shock, thus by the perfect gas theory, the temperature too. 

Contact (or slip) discontinuities are surfaces that separate zones of different density and temperature. Pressure is however in equilibrium for the two sides, and there is no mass exchange. Tangential velocities are often very different, giving the name 'slip' discontinuities. The difference with shock is that shock conserve speed and not pressure.

\subsection{Explain propagation of disturbances in a subsonic and supersonic flow (sound waves). Discuss Mach waves}

Consider a static source emitting infinitely small perturbations in a standstill fluid. These propagates in all direction with the \textbf{speed of sound}. If the source stands still, the perturbations stay within always larger concentric circles. 

\wrapfig{7}{l}{3}{0.1}{ch8/2}{ch8/2}
Suppose now that the source moves to the left with $V_\infty < a$. After a certain time $t^*$, the source will move from A to B. But in that interval the first perturbation circle has enlarged from $at^*$ and with center A. If we devide the time interval into 5, we will have a situation like on the figure. We can see that the perturbations are both downstream and upstream of the source.  

\minifig{ch8/3}{ch8/4}{0.5}{0.4}{0.3}{0.3}

Consider now the case $V_\infty = a$ and the case $V_\infty > a$ represented above. There is now no perturbation upstream the perturbation. In particular, in the first case the perturbation are situated in the half plane downstream the source and the second within a cone of opening $2\mu$ called the \textbf{Mach cone}. From the figure, we can directly deduce: 

\begin{equation}
\sin \mu = \frac{a}{V_\infty} = \frac{1}{M_\infty}.
\end{equation}

The area within the cone is the \textbf{area of action} and outside the \textbf{area of silence}. The lines separating both are the \textbf{Mach waves}.

\wrapfig{7}{l}{6}{0.25}{ch8/5}{ch8/5}
Now consider the reversed case where the source (an infinitesimal irregularity) is standing still and the fluid is moving. Here also we get the same results. Within the assumption of small perturbations, the following equation (elliptic) is valid for supersonic flows: 

\begin{equation}
\lambda ^2 \hat{\phi} _{xx} - \hat{\phi}_{yy} = 0 \qquad \lambda ^2 = M_\infty ^2 -1
\end{equation}

for subsonic, the signs are reversed. The general solution of this equation was: $\hat{\phi} = f(x-\lambda y) + g(x+\lambda y)$. But $\frac{1}{\lambda} = \tan \mu$ and thus: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi} = f(y - x\tan \mu) + g(y + x \tan \mu)
\end{equation}

the solution is constant along straight lines of slope $\pm \mu$ which corresponds to the Mach waves. Mach waves are thus characteristics of the \textbf{hyperbolic} equation: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi} _{xx} = \tan^2 \mu \hat{\phi} _{yy} 
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Subcritical and supercritical waves}
\wrapfig{5}{l}{3.5}{0.05}{ch8/8}{ch8/8}
Consider a wave of height h after one time, the equations are: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\D }{\D x} (uh) + \frac{\D}{\D y} (vh) = 0\\
\mbox{x-mom: } &\frac{\D}{\D x } (u^2 + gh) + \frac{\D}{\D y} (uv) = 0\\
\mbox{y-mom: } &\frac{\D}{\D x } (uv) + \frac{\D}{\D y} (v^2 + gh) = 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\sqrt{gh}$ is the speed of waves on water. A relation between Mach and Froude number can be made since $a = \sqrt{\gamma p /\rho}$: 

\begin{equation}
M = \sqrt{\frac{u^2 + v^2}{\frac{\gamma p}{\rho}}} \qquad Fr = \sqrt{\frac{u^2 + v^2}{gh}}
\end{equation}

If $Fr > 1$: supercritical = supersonic, if $Fr < 1$: subcritical = subsonic.

\section{Discuss characteristic theory for a first order scalar wave equation}
\subsection{Discuss the theory of characteristics for a first order linear wave equation with wave speed a. Define characteristic curves, what are Riemann invariants. Can discontinuous solutions exist ?}
We will discuss different cases:

\subsubsection{a cst}	
The prototype equation is the linear scalar wave equation: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D u}{\D x} + a \frac{\D u}{\D y} = 0
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{9}{l}{6}{0.2}{ch8/9}{ch8/9}
where x is the "time-like" coordinate, y the "space-like" one, a is the convection speed and the initial condition is $u(x,0) = f(y)$. The solution of this is a wave: 
\begin{equation}
u(x,y) = f(y-ax) = f(q(x,y))
\end{equation}
If $y-ax = cst$ then $u= cst$, which corresponds to $\frac{dy}{dx}$ \textbf{characteristic curves}. Consider on the figure that left is inlet and right is outlet, then the wave moves to right with speed $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = a$. 

\subsubsection{a linear}
If a is not a constant but respects $a = a(x,y)$ the results are similar. 

\begin{proof}
	Since the coordinate y is expressed like $y = ax + cst$, $u$ only depends on x. So if $\frac{du}{dx} = 0$ this means that $u = cst$. Let's compute: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	\frac{du(y(x),x)}{dx} = \frac{\D u}{\D y} \frac{d y}{dx} + \frac{\D u}{\D x} = \frac{\D u}{\D x} -a \frac{\D u}{\D y} = 0
	\end{equation}
	
	which is satisfied since we retrieve the wave equation and u is a solution. 
\end{proof}

\wrapfig{7}{l}{5}{0.2}{ch8/10}{ch8/10}
The result is shown here, the only change is that the wave is deformed since the propagation speed is not constant. 

\textbf{Riemann invariant} are constant along the characteristic curves.

Flow equations allow non-continuous solutions $\rightarrow$ weak. We limit the study to stationary weak solutions, satisfying Euler's equation

\subsection{What changes for a nonlinear wave equation, take the case a(u) = u}

\subsubsection{a non linear}
In the case a is expressed as $a(u,x,y)$ nothing changes, $\frac{dy}{dx} = a(u,x,y)$ are the characteristics and $u = cst$ along them. The proof is same as before, $y = y(x)$ on the characteristics and $\frac{du}{dx} = 0$. The only change is a depending on 3 variables.  


	
	Consider
	\begin{equation}
	a = u \qquad \frac{\D u}{\D x} + u \frac{\D u }{\D y} = 0 
	\end{equation}
	
	The solution $u=cst$ on characteristic curves $\frac{dy}{dx} = u$. This means that characteristics are straight lines since $u=cst$ along them and is the slope. They only differs from the initial data $u = f(y)$ at $x = 0$. There are 2 cases to consider since the wave can be converging or diverging as shown on below figures. 
	
	\minifig{ch8/11}{ch8/12}{0.3}{0.3}{0.3}{0.3}
	
	The first one corresponds to an expansion wave, the characteristics are diverging. The wave is smoothened during its expansion on x-axis. In the second case, the characteristics are converging and we call it compression wave. This leads to wave steepening. At the characteristics intersection we have an \textbf{overturning wave} as shown, this is a tripled value solution. 
	
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{ch8/13}
		\captionof{figure}{}
	\end{center}		
	
	This is due to the fact that the wave moves slower near the ground (ex: wave at the beach). But with Euler equations this is not permitted since the solution has to be unique and thus can be interpreted as a shock wave.

\section{Discuss characteristic theory for steady supersonic potential flow}
\subsection{What are the assumptions for potential flow}
Irrotational velocity field, steady flow, isentropic flow.

\subsection{Write the two equations which govern the velocity components u and v.}

\begin{equation}

\begin{aligned}
&\left( 1 - \frac{u^2}{a^2} \right) u_x - \frac{uv}{a^2} (u_y + v_x) + \left( 1  \frac{v^2}{a^2} \right) v_y = 0\\
& v_x - u_y = 0
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}

	This can be put in matrix form as follows: 

\begin{equation}

\left( 
\begin{array}{c}

\frac{\D}{\D y}

\begin{array}{c}

\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}

Now we do like in previous section, compute the eigenvalues:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\lambda ^2 \left( 1-\frac{u^2}{a^2} \right) + \frac{2 uv}{a^2}\lambda + \left(1-\frac{v^2}{a^2} \right) = 0\\
&\Delta = - 1 + \frac{u^2 + v^2}{a^2} \quad \Rightarrow \lambda ^\pm = \frac{-uv\pm a^2 \sqrt{M^2 - 1}}{a^2 - u^2} \in \mathcal{R}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}	 

where $\lambda^\pm \in \mathcal{R}$ since $M>1$. We can find after computations that: 

\begin{equation}
\lambda ^\pm = \tan (\theta \pm \mu )
\end{equation}

where $\theta$  is the flow angle and $\mu $ the Mach angle with: $\sin \mu = \frac{1}{M}, \tan \theta = \frac{u}{v}$  and $\tan \mu = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M^2-1}}$.  The curves are thus: 

\begin{equation}
C^+: \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^+ = \tan (theta + \mu) \qquad C^-: \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) ^- = \tan (theta - \mu )
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ch8/18}
\end{center}

Now as the eigenvalues are real, we can diagonalize by finding the left eigenvectors and computing $W = LU$, where $L = (l^+ \ l^-)^t$ such that for "+": 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D W^+}{\D x} + D\frac{\D W^+}{\D y} = 0
\end{equation}

We get a decoupled system of equation. To find L, the same method as previously is used, \textbf{a trick is to choose} $\bm{\sigma = a^2 - u^2}$ \textbf{and to compute} \bm{$\mu$} \textbf{using the system of equation} $\bm{LA = DL}$. We get: 

\begin{equation}
l^+ = (a^2 - u^2\quad -uv +\sqrt{M^2 -1})
\end{equation}

The equation can be rewritten as a derivative along the streamline: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{d W^+}{d s^+} =  0 \qquad \Rightarrow l^+ \frac{d U}{d s^+} = 0 = (a^2 - u^2 )\frac{d u}{d s^+} + (-uv + a^2\sqrt{M^2-1})\frac{dv}{ds^+}
\end{equation}

Now we can use a transformation $(u,v) \rightarrow (M, \theta)$: 

\begin{equation}
u = a M\cos \theta \qquad v = a M \sin \theta \qquad a_t = a^2 \left( 1+\frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M^2 \right)
\end{equation}

where the last equation comes from the total enthalpy, $a = \sqrt{\gamma R T} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma p}{\rho}}$ and $\frac{c_p}{c_p - c_v}= \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}$: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
H = cst = h + \frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} \qquad \Leftrightarrow \frac{\gamma}{\gamma R}c_p T + \frac{u^2+v^2}{2} = c_p T_T \frac{\gamma R}{\gamma R} \\
\Leftrightarrow \frac{a^2 c_p}{\gamma R} + \frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} = \frac{a^2_t c_p}{\gamma R} \qquad \Leftrightarrow a^2 \left( 1 + M\frac{\gamma -1 }{2} \right) = a^2_t
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Then when we solve for $M, \theta$, we get: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\sqrt{M^2-1}}{M \left(1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M^2\right)}\frac{dM}{ds^+} - \frac{d\theta }{ds^+} = 0
\end{equation}

And if we integrate this and define the \textbf{Prandtl-Meyer function} \bm{$\nu (M)$}, we have for the Riemann invariants: 

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\begin{equation}
		C^+: - \nu (M) = \theta = cst = K^+ (M,\theta) \qquad C^-:  \nu (M) = \theta = cst = K^- (M,\theta) 
		\end{equation}
	}
\end{center}

\minifig{ch8/19}{ch8/20}{0.2}{0.2}{0.49}{0.49}	

The situation is represented above, remark that the points P and Q depends on all the points upstream them outside the cone. Since the characteristics slope depends on the local $M$ and $\theta$,  for the \textbf{method of characteristics} one has to compute all the solutions on $C^\pm$ upstream P to compute the solution in P. 

\subsection{What are simple wave solutions, explain properties of simple waves. Explain why one of the families of characteristic curves are given by straight lines}

A simple wave solution is a solution for which the Riemann invariant is constant on the whole space (x,y)	and not only on the characteristics. There exist two types since we have 2 families of characteristics. 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch8/21}
	\captionof{figure}{}
\end{center}

It is easy to see that the slope of $C^-$ and $C^+$ in respectively case 1 and 2 is constant, for example for case 2: 

\begin{equation}
C^+ : \theta - \nu (M) = {Cst}_1 \qquad \mbox{but } \theta + \nu(M) {Cst}_2\qquad \Rightarrow (\theta  , nu)= cst
\end{equation}

\wrapfig{17}{l}{6}{0.15}{ch8/23}{ch8/23}
There exist a limit downstream velocity: 

\begin{equation}
h = c_pT_t = c_p T + \frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} = cst
\end{equation}

We can see that a max velocity can be obtained if $T = 0$: $V_{lim}^2 = c_p T_t$ and the corresponding Mach number is $M_{lim} = \frac{V_{lim}}{\sqrt{\gamma RT}} = \infty$ ($a_{lim}=0$). In that case the Mach angle is 

\begin{equation}
\mu = \arcsin \left( \frac{1}{\infty} \right) = 0
\end{equation}

This means that the \textbf{Mach line collapse with the streamline}. In fact, we will have an inviscid separation downstream and there will be a \textbf{vacuum} where no molecule can be. This is shown on \autoref{ch8/24}.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.08]{ch8/24}
	\captionof{figure}{}
	\label{ch8/24}
\end{center}

\subsection{Discuss simple waves in the hodograph plane.}

As shown in \autoref{ch8/24} they look like a fan, with a limit for the limit case described above.

\subsection{Apply to flow around a convex bend and to flow around a sharp convex corner. Explain why this is an expansion}

\wrapfig{7}{l}{6}{0.15}{ch8/6}{ch8/6}
Consider in the figure the convention $d\theta < 0$. The infinitely small $d\theta$ induces an infinitely small perturbation noted $V+dV$. Since the Mach wave is also a solution of the flow equations, $V_t$ before and after the Mach wave is the same. We have: 

\ \\

\begin{equation}
V_t = V\cos \mu = (V+dV) \cos (\mu - d\theta) \qquad \Leftrightarrow 1+\frac{dV}{V} = \frac{\cos \mu }{\cos (\mu - d\theta)}
\label{eq:8.63}
\end{equation}

Using the fact that $d\theta$ is very small we get: 

\begin{equation}
1+\frac{dV}{V} \approx \frac{\cos \mu }{\cos \mu + d\theta \sin \mu } = \frac{1}{1 + d\theta \tan \mu} \approx 1- d\theta \tan \mu \quad \Rightarrow d\theta = - \sqrt{M^2 - 1} \frac{dV}{V} 
\label{eq:dV/V}
\end{equation}

Let's now try to rewrite the $dV/V$ as a function of $M$. We know from the definition of M that: 

\begin{equation}
M = \frac{V}{a} \qquad \Rightarrow \frac{dM}{M} = \frac{dV}{V} - \frac{da}{a}
\end{equation}

In addition we have the total temperature constant across the shock and its derivative gives: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\gamma R T_t = a^2 \left( 1+ \frac{\gamma -1}{2} M^2\right) = cst \qquad \Leftrightarrow 2ada \left( 1+ \frac{\gamma -1}{2} M^2\right)+ a^2 (\gamma -1) M dM = 0  \\
\Rightarrow \frac{da}{a} = - \frac{\gamma-1}{2}\frac{MdM}{1+ \frac{\gamma -1}{2} M^2}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

We can now replace these values in \eqref{eq:dV/V} and get: 

\begin{equation}
d\theta = -\frac{\sqrt{M^2 -1}}{1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2} M^2}\frac{dM}{M}
\end{equation}

and after integration: 

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\textbf{Prandtl-Meyer function}	
		\begin{equation}
		\theta = - \nu (M) + K^- \qquad \nu (M) = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma + 1 }{\gamma -1}} \arctan \sqrt{\frac{\gamma - 1 }{\gamma +1} (M^2 - 1)} - \arctan\sqrt{M^2 - 1}
		\end{equation}
	}
\end{center}

Additionally, consider a decrease of $\theta$ between a point 1 and 2, the integration will give: 

\begin{equation}
\theta _2 - \theta _1 = \delta \theta = -\nu (M_2) + \nu (M_1)
\end{equation}

Since $\delta \theta < 0$, same for right hand side, meaning $\nu (M_2)>\nu (M_1)$ and since $\nu$ is monotonously increasing with M, $M_2 > M_1 \Rightarrow$ \textbf{expansion}. If the properties in 1 are known, we can find the $\nu (M_2)$ and thus the $M_2$.

\subsubsection{Prandtl-Meyer expansion}

\wrapfig{11}{l}{6}{0.1}{ch8/27}{ch8/27}
Now we can consider a bend. This can be subdivided into infinitely small bendings with each involving a change of angle and a Mach wave. The Mach wave will keep growing with the angle changes, inducing the Mach wave to decrease continuously, thus the Mach waves never cross each other. When the flow goes through a Mach wave, this induces an infinitely small change of angle, and this done infinitely will end up to a finite change of angle. Remark that the flow in a beginning corner and ending corner is the same.  Again, with this reasoning we can conclude that at a straight corner there are infinite Mach waves in a single point. 

\wrapfig{9}{r}{4}{0.15}{ch8/28}{ch8/28}
The variation of M is dictated by the $C^-$ curve. The Mach wave is perpendicular to the tangent at the curve at this point. Such flow is called Prandtl-Meyer expansion.

\section{Oblique shock relations for steady 2D inviscid flow}
\subsection{Define critical state, critical Mach number, what are the key properties of the critical sound speed – compare with total state.}

The critical state is defined as bringing a state $P\{\rho,T,u,p,a\}$ to sonic speed using an isentropic transformation $\frac{p}{\rho ^{\gamma}}=\frac{p^*}{\rho ^{*^\gamma}}$. The critical sound speed is constant over a streamline.

The total(stagnation) state brings $P$ to stand still using an isentropic transformation. $H=c_pT_t=c_pT+\frac{||u||^2}{2}$

\subsection{The characteristic (or Critical) Mach number}
It is defined as: 

\begin{equation}
M^* = \frac{q}{a^*} \qquad a^* = \sqrt{\gamma R T^*}
\end{equation}

where q is the module of the velocity, $a^*$ and $T^*$ the speed of sound and the static temperature at $M=1$. Remind that $T = T_t - \frac{v^2}{2c_p}$, if we use: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
T_t = T \left(1+ \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2 \right) \qquad &\Rightarrow \left( \frac{M^*}{M}\right)^2 = \frac{T^*}{T} \cdot \left( \frac{T_t}{T_t}\right) = \frac{\frac{\gamma + 1}{2}}{1+ \frac{\gamma -1}{2}M^2}\\
&\Rightarrow M^{*^2} =  \frac{\frac{\gamma + 1}{2}M^2}{1+ \frac{\gamma -1}{2}M^2}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:8.74}
\end{equation}

This implicity assumes that the total temperature is conserved across the shock, but this is indeed the case. We directly deduce that: 

\begin{equation}
M < 1 \Leftrightarrow M^* <1 \qquad M \geq 1 \Leftrightarrow M^* \geq 1
\label{eq:8.75}
\end{equation}

Similarly we can define the characteristic normal Mach number: 

\begin{equation}
M^*_n = \frac{u_n }{a^{**}} \qquad a^{**}  = \sqrt{\gamma R T^{**}}
\end{equation}

where $a^{**}$ and $T^{**}$ are the speed of sound and static temperature when the normal Mach number = 1. We can express a relation for the temperatures in normal variables from the definition of total temperature: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&T_t = T + \frac{\vec{v}^2}{2c_p} \Leftrightarrow T_t - \frac{v_t^2}{2c_p} = T + \frac{v_n^2}{2c_p}\qquad \Leftrightarrow \bar{T}_t = T\left(1 + \frac{\gamma -1}{2}M^2_n \right)\\
&\Rightarrow T^{**}= \frac{\bar{T}_t}{\frac{\gamma +1}{2}}\qquad \Rightarrow M^{*^2}_n = \frac{\frac{\gamma +1}{2}M^2_n}{1+ \frac{\gamma -1}{2}M^2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We find exactly the same relations as previously and \eqref{eq:8.75} is valid for normal variables.
\subsection{Derive the relation between normal critical Mach numbers before and behind an oblique shock}

\wrapfig{8}{l}{5}{0.15}{ch8/32}{ch8/32}
Consider a compression with deflection angle $\theta$ leading to the shock wave angle $\beta$. The governing equations are: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cc}
\rho _1 v_{n1} = \rho _2 v_{n2} & p_1 + \rho _1 v_{n1}^2 = p_2 + \rho _2 v_{n2}^2\\
v_{t1} = v_{t2} & H_1 = H_2\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

If we devide the equation with pressure by $\rho v_n$: 

\begin{equation}
R\left( \frac{T_1}{v_{n1}} - \frac{T_2}{v_{n2}} \right) = v_{n2} - v_{n1}
\end{equation}

If we use the constant total temperature across the shock, we find: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\bar{T}_t = T_1 \frac{v_{n1}^2}{2c_p} = T_2 \frac{v_{n2}^2}{2c_p} \qquad \Rightarrow R\left( \frac{T_1}{v_{n1}} - \frac{T_2}{v_{n2}} \right) - \frac{R}{2c_p}\left( v_{n1} - v_{n2} \right) = v_{n2} - v_{n1} \\
\Rightarrow v_{1n}v_{2n} = \frac{2\gamma }{\gamma +1 } R\bar{T}_t = (a^{**})^2
\end{array}
\label{eq:8.80}
\end{equation}

From this developpement we finally get an important relation for the Mach numbers before and after the shock: 

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\begin{equation}
		M_{1n}^* M_{2n}^* = 1
		\end{equation}		
	}
\end{center}

We are now able to compute $M_2$ knowing $M_1$. First compute $M_{1n} = M_1 \sin \beta $, then $M_1^*$ using \eqref{eq:8.74}, we get $M_2^*$ from our last relation and we go backward: $M_2 = \frac{M_{n2}}{\sin (\beta -\theta)}$.

\paragraph{Remark} \quad In theory there are two possible cases: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&M_{n1} > 1 \Rightarrow M_{n1}^* > 1 \Rightarrow M_{n2}^* < 1 \Rightarrow M_{n2} < 1\\
&M_{n1} < 1 \Rightarrow M_{n1}^* < 1 \Rightarrow M_{n2}^* > 1 \Rightarrow M_{n2} > 1
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The second one corresponds to an expansion wave and is physically not possible because it leads to an decrease of entropy as we will see later.

\subsection{Derive the relation between densities before and behind the shock}

From the mass conservation equation we directly get:

\begin{center}
	\theor{
		\begin{equation}
		\frac{\rho _2}{\rho _1} = \frac{v_{n1}}{v_{n2}} \left(\frac{v_{n1}}{v_{n1}} \right) = \frac{v_{n1}^2}{a^{**^2}} = M^{*^2}_{n1}
		\end{equation}
	}
\end{center}
and we conclude that the density over the shock increases. 

\subsection{Discuss the graph $\theta$ (flow angle) as a function of $\beta$ (shock angle) with upstream Mach number as a parameter.}

\wrapfig{6}{l}{5}{0.15}{ch8/35}{ch8/35}	
Referring to the figure we can note: $\tan \beta = \frac{u_{n1}}{u_{t1}}$ and $\tan (\beta - \theta ) = \frac{u_{n2}}{u_{t2}}$. After further developpements: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\tan (\beta - \theta) = \frac{1}{M^{*2}_{n1}} = \frac{2 + (\gamma -1 )M_1^2\sin ^2 \beta }{(\gamma  +1) M_1^2\sin ^2 \beta}\\
&\Leftrightarrow \tan \theta = 2 \coth \beta \frac{M_1^2\sin ^2 \beta -1}{M_1^2 (\gamma + \cos 2\beta ) +2}
\end{aligned}	
\end{equation}

We find thus a relation between $\theta, \beta$ and $M_1$ and this can be plot on the ($\theta, \beta$) plane.

\subsubsection{Interpretation of the $\beta, \theta, M$ curves}
\minifig{ch8/36}{ch8/37}{0.12}{0.16}{0.49}{0.49}
For a given $M, \theta$, there are two possible $\beta$. The highest is the \textbf{strong shock} and the lower is the \textbf{weak shock}. This is due to the increasing pressure gradient between regions 2 and 1 when $\beta$ increases. The solution depends on the downstream pressure condition, if we have a low pressure, weak shock is more likely appearing and the contrary when a high pressure is imposed. \textbf{In this course we always take the weak shock!} \\

Now take for example $M=2$ and $\theta = 30\degres$, there is no solution on the graph. In this case there is no straight oblique shock but a \textbf{detached bow shock}, it occurs upstream the corner and is bent.  Note that for higher $M_1$ the $\theta _{max}$ increases and after $46\degres$ there is no attached solution. \\

Now look at $\theta = 0\degres$, one of the solution is $\beta = 90\degres$ whatever $M_1$ and the other solution is dependent on $M_1$. The first case corresponds to a \textbf{normal shock}. The other one corresponds to $\beta = \mu$ and thus the \textbf{Mach wave}, as previously seen this is the infinitely weak solution.

\minifig{ch8/38}{ch8/39}{0.15}{0.15}{0.49}{0.49}
If we increase the Mach number keeping the deflection constant, we have $\beta$ decreasing, but this means that pressure ratio is increasing. The shock is stronger. When the velocity is kept constant and the deflection increases, $\beta$ increases and this also means that the pressure ratio increases and thus the wave gets stronger. This has an application for supersonic planes that try to get the weakest shock. As the temperature rising is higher for stronger shock, this is to avoid.

\section{Oblique shock relations}
\subsection{Derive the shock polar for the velocity components behind the shock, with the upstream velocity as a parameter (shock polar in the hodograph plane)}
The so-called hodograph plane is the (u,v) plane. It can be constructed as follow:\\
\wrapfig{8}{l}{5}{0.15}{ch8/35}{ch8/35}	
Consider the compression as shown in graphe\autoref{ch8/35} for a finite angle change $\theta$. Assume that velocity $\vec{u_1}$ before the angle change is known and of x-direction(flow only in x); the velocity $\vec{u_2}$ can be calculated using the relations seen in previous questions. It makes an angle theta (since the flow is deflected from an angle theta).

To compute $\vec{u_2}$ starting from $u_{1n}u_{2n}=a^{*^{2}}-\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1}u_{t}^{2}$, let's pass in cartesian axes where $\vec{u_2}=u_21_x+v_21_y$, $u_2=||\vec{u_2}||cos(\theta)$, $v_2=||\vec{u_2}||sin(theta)$, one gets $u_1 sin(\beta)|\vec{u_2}sin(\beta-\theta)=a^{*^2}-\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma +1}u_{1}^{2}cos^2(\beta)$.

\wrapfig{15}{r}{8}{0.30}{ch8/42}{ch8/42}

Using $tg^2(\beta)=\frac{u_1-v_2}{u_2}$, after some calculation:
\begin{equation}
	v_2^2=(u_1-u_2)^2\frac{a^{*^{2}}-u_1u_2}{a^{*^{2}}+\frac{2}{\gamma+1}u_1^2-u_1u_2}
\end{equation}

or, with $\vec{u_1}=\frac{u_1}{M_1^*}$, $\vec{u_2}=\frac{u_2}{a^*}$ and $\vec{v_2}=\frac{v_2}{a^*}$:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{v_2}^{\,2}=(\vec{u_1}-\vec{u_2})^2\frac{1-\vec{u_1}\vec{u_2}}{1+\frac{2}{\gamma +1}\vec{u_1}-\vec{u_1}\vec{u_2}}
\end{equation}


These two can be drawn in the hodograph, where we can see that we have two solutions for the strong and weak shock, and where $\beta$ is the angle from the vertical passing at the end of $\vec{v_2}$ and the line connecting the two speed vectors. By drawing the positions of the end of $\vec{v_2}$ for various $\theta$, we obtain the shock polar for $M_1$ fixed. Note that the axis are often give divided by $a^*$.

\subsection{Using this graph, discuss maximum deviation, weak shock and strong shock solutions, normal shock and Mach wave}
The maximum deviation can easily be seen on the graph by taking the tangent to the shock polar from the origin ($\theta_{max}$). The weak and strong shock where discussed before, the Mach wave is for an infinitively weak shock, hence when the two velocities are identical. The normal shock is the strong version of the Mach wave, one can see that we have an angle $\beta$ of 90\degres .

\subsection{Consider the flow around a sharp concave corner. Using the above graph,	find the downstream Mach number for a given upstream Mach number}
One can just draw the circle around the origin passing through the end of $\vec{u_2}$, the radius is $M_2$.

\subsection{Discuss the shock structure appearing for supersonic flow around a cylindrical body}
Nothing found in the slides or notes about this, so personal interpretation.

As the cylinder can be seen as a variable angle wall starting from 90\degres to 0\degres in compression, then going the other way around in expansion, one would expect a detached shock in front of the cylinder (curved shock) that reattaches going near to the radius of the cylinder and follows it's curvature. The same would happen on the expansion side, with the shock detaching after an angle of just above 50\degres (53 was said to be a limit value for most cases).


\subsection{Discuss shock reflection in a supersonic channel}
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.33\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ch9/5}
		\captionof{figure}{}
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}

	\begin{minipage}{0.25\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.11]{ch9/7}
		\captionof{figure}{}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}

The situation is represented on the first figure, the flow is first deviated by the first shock then the flow must be horizontal near the upper wall, this is possible by a second shock wave appearing at the intersection between the first shock and the upper wall (reflection shock). If this shock touches the lower wall a new shock will appear deviating the flow and so on. The velocities and the pressures can be retrieved as shown on the figures.

\wrapfig{10}{r}{10}{0.30}{ch9/24}{ch9/24}
Sometimes  the angle is too big and there is no crossing  from the polar curve, a normal shock appears (Mach reflexion), which connects with the lower wall shock via a bowed shock, with a slip line across which only pressures are conserved. This type of bowed shocks also appear when having a crossing of shocks\autoref{ch9/24}.
